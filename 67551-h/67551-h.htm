<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;margin-bottom:0.5em;'>Red Bay, Labrador, Sept. 9, 1919.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:0em;'><span class='sc'>Dear Waldo</span>:</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has been great having you on board for a
time. I wish you could stay and see some
other sections of the work. When you joined
us I hesitated at first, thinking perhaps it would
be better to show you the poorer parts of our
country, and not the better off—but decided to
let you drop in and drop out again of the
ordinary routine, and not bother to ‘show you
sights.’ Still I am sorry that you did not see
some other sections of the people. There is to
me in life always an infinite satisfaction in
accomplishing anything. I don’t care so much
what it is. But if it has involved real anxiety,
especially as to the possibility of success, it
always returns to me a prize worth while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, you have been over some parts, where
things have somehow materialized. The reindeer
experiment I also estimate an accomplished
success, as it completely demonstrated
our predictions, and as it is now in good hands
and prospering. The Seamen’s Institute, in
having become self-supporting and now demanding
more space, has also been a real encouragement
to go ahead in other lines. But
there is one thing better than accomplishment,
and that is opportunity; as the problem is
better than the joy of writing Q. E. D.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So I would have liked to show you White
Bay as far as La Scie, where our friends are
fighting with few assets, and many discouragements.
It certainly has left them poor, and
often hungry and naked, but it has made men
of them, and they have taught me many lessons;
and it would do your viewpoint good to
see how many debts these people place me
under.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If life is the result of stimuli, believe me we
ought to know what life means in a country
where you are called on to create every day
something, big or small. On the other hand,
if life consists of the multitude of things one
possesses, then Labrador should be graded far
from where I place it, in its relation to Philadelphia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A thousand thanks for coming so far to
give us your good message of brotherly
sympathy.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:5em;'>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;'><span class='sc'>Wilfred T. Grenfell</span>.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span><h1>I<br/>“DOCTOR”</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Grenfell and Labrador are names
that must go down in history together.
Of the man and of his sea-beaten,
wind-swept “parish” it will be said, as Kipling
wrote of Cecil Rhodes:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Living he was the land, and dead</p>
<p class='line0'>His soul shall be her soul.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Some folk may try to tell us that Wilfred
Thomason Grenfell, C.M.G., gets more credit
than is due him: but while they cavil and
insinuate the Recording Angel smiles and
writes down more golden deeds for this descendant
of an Elizabethan sea-dog. Sir
Richard Grenville, of the <span class='it'>Revenge</span>, as Tennyson
tells us—stood off sixty-three ships of
Spain’s Armada, and was mortally wounded
in the fight, crying out as he fell upon the
deck: “I have only done my duty, as a man
is bound to do.” That tradition of heroic
devotion to duty, and of service to mankind,
is ineradicable from the Grenfell blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve had a hideous winter,” the Doctor
said, as I clasped hands with him in June at
the office of the Grenfell Association in New
York. His hair was whiter and his bronzed
face more serious than when I last had seen
him; but the unforgettable look in his eyes
of resolution and of self-command was there
as of old, intensified by the added years of
warfare with belligerent nature and sometimes
recalcitrant mankind. For a few moments
when he talks sentence may link itself
to sentence very gravely, but nobody ever
knew the Doctor to go long without that
keen, bright flash of a smile, provoked by a
ready and a constant sense of fun, that
illumines his face like a pulsation of the
Northern Lights, and—unless you are hard as
steel at heart—must make you love him, and
do what he wants you to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor on this occasion was a month
late for his appointment with the board of
directors of the Grenfell Association. His
little steamer, the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span>, had been frozen
in off his base of operations and inspirations
at St. Anthony. So he started afoot for
Conch to catch a launch that would take him
to the railroad. He was three days covering
a distance which in summer would have required
but a few hours, in the direction of
White Bay on the East Coast. He slept on
the beach in wet clothes. Then he was caught
on pans of ice and fired guns to attract the
notice of any chance vessel. Once more
ashore, he vainly started five times more from
St. Anthony harbour. Finally he went north
and walked along the coast, cutting across
when he could, eighty miles to Flower’s Cove.
In the meantime the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span>, with Mrs.
Grenfell aboard, was imprisoned in the ice on
the way to Seal Harbour; and it was three
weeks before Mrs. Grenfell, with the aid of
two motor-boats, reached the railroad by way
of Shoe Cove.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Flower’s Cove the Doctor rapped at the
door of Parson Richards. That good man
fairly broke into an alleluia to behold him.
With beaming face he started to prepare his
hero a cup of tea. But there came a cry at
the door: “Abe Gould has shot himself in
the leg!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out into the cold and the dark again the
Doctor stumbled. He put his hand into the
leg and took out the bone and the infected
parts with such instruments as he had. Then
he sat up all night, feeding his patient sleeping
potions of opium. With the day came
the mail-boat for the south, the Ethie, beaten
back from two desperate attempts to penetrate
the ice of the Strait to Labrador.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two months later I rejoined the Doctor at
Croucher’s wharf, at Battle Harbour, Labrador.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little <span class='it'>Strathcona</span>, snuggling against the
piles, was redolent of whalemeat for the dogs,
her decks piled high with spruce and fir, white
birch and juniper, for her insatiable fires.
(Coal was then $24 a ton.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’ve you been all this time?” the
Doctor cried, as I flung my belongings to his
deck from the <span class='it'>Ethie’s</span> mail-boat, and he held
out both hands with his radiant smile of greeting.
“I’m just about to make the rounds of
the hospital. This is a busy day. We pull
out for St. Anthony tonight!” With that
he took me straight to the bedside of his
patients in the little Battle Harbour hospital
that wears across its battered face the legend:
“Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least
of these my brethren ye did it unto me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first man was recovering from typhoid,
and the Doctor, with a smile, was satisfied with
his convalescence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next man complained of a pain in the
abdomen. Dr. Grenfell inquired about the intensity
of the pain, the temperature, the appetite
and the sleep of the patient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has two of the four cardinal symptoms,”
said the Doctor, “pain and temperature.
Probably it’s an appendical attack.
We had a boy who—like this man—looked
all right outwardly, and yet was found to have
a bad appendix.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor has a way of thinking aloud as
he goes along, and taking others into his confidence—frequently
by an interrogation which
is flattering in the way in which he imputes
superior knowledge to the one of whom the
question is asked. It is a liberal education in
the healing craft to go about with him, for he
is never secretive or mysterious—he is frankly
human instead of oracular.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How about your schooner?” was his next
question. “Do you think that they can get
along without you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He never forgets that these are fishermen,
whose livelihood depends on getting every
hour they can with their cod-traps, and the
stages and the flakes where the fish is salted
and spread to dry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third patient was a whaler. He had
caught his hand in a winch. The bones of the
second and third fingers of the right hand
were cracked, and the tips of those fingers had
been cut off. The hand lay in a hot bath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dirty work, whaling,” was the Doctor’s
comment, as he examined the wound.
“Everything is rotten meat and a wound
easily becomes infected.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number four was a baffling case of multiple
gangrene. This Bonne Bay fisherman had a
nose and an ear that looked as if they had
turned to black rubber. His toes were
sloughing off. The back of his right hand
was like raw beef. His left leg was bent at
an angle of 90 degrees, and as it could not
bear the pressure of the bedclothes a scaffolding
had been built over it. The teeth were
gone, and when the dressings were removed
even the plucking of the small hairs on the
leg gave the patient agony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you been eating?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Potatoes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Turnips, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You need green food. Fresh vegetable
salts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor looked out of the window and
saw a dandelion in the rank green grass.
“That’s what he ought to have,” was his
comment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the verandah were four out-of-door
patients to whom fresh air was essential. One
had a tubercular spine. A roll of plaster had
been coming by freight all summer long and
was impatiently awaited. But a delay of
months on the Labrador is nothing unusual.
Dr. Daly, of Harvard, presented the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span>
with a searchlight, and it was two years
on the way—most of that time stored in a
warehouse at North Sydney.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Around these fresh-air cases the verandah
was netted with rabbit-wire. That was to keep
the dogs from breaking in and possibly eating
the patients, who are in mortal terror of the
dogs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Doctor took a probe from the
hand of a trusted assistant he was careful to
ask if it was sterile ere he used it. He constantly
took his juniors—in this instance,
Johns Hopkins doctors—into consultation.
“What do you think?” was his frequent
query.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The use of unhallowed patent medicines
gave him distress. “O the stuff the people
put into themselves!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have we got a Dakin solution?” he asked
presently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve been trying to get a chloramine solution
all summer,” answered one of the young
physicians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor made a careful examination of
the man with the tubercular spine, who was
encased in plaster from the waist up. “After
all,” was his comment as he rose to his feet,
“doctors don’t do anything but keep things
clean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the women’s ward the Harris Cot, the
Torquay Cot, the Northfield Cot, the Victoria
Cot, the Kingman Cot, the Exeter Cot were
filled with patient souls whose faces shone as
the Doctor passed. “More fresh air!” he
ejaculated, and other windows were opened.
Those who came from homes hermetically
sealed have not always understood the Doctor’s
passion for ozone. One man complained
that the wind got in his teeth and a girl said
that the singing on Sundays strained her
stomach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had a remarkable memory for the history
of each case. “The day after you left
her heart started into fibrillation,” said an
assistant. “It was there before we left,”
answered the Doctor quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At one bedside where an operation of a
novel nature had been performed he remarked,
“I simply hate leaving an opening when I
don’t know how to close it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He never pretends to know it all: he never
sits down with folded hands in the face of a
difficulty or “passes the buck” to another.
In his running commentary while he looks the
patient over he confesses his perplexities. Yet
all that he says confirms rather than shakes
the patient’s confidence in him. Those whom
he serves almost believe that he can all but
raise the dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now this rash,” he said, “might mean
the New World smallpox—but probably it
doesn’t. We’ve only had two deaths from that
malady on the coast. It ran synchronously
with the ‘flu.’ In one household where
there were three children and a man, one
child and the man got it and two children
escaped it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This woman’s ulcers are the sequel to
smallpox. She needs the vegetable salts of a
fresh diet. How to get green things for her
is the problem. And this patient has tubercular
caries of the hip. The X-ray apparatus
is across the Straits at St. Anthony, sixty miles
away. If we only had a portable X-ray
apparatus of the kind they used in the war!
Now you see, no matter what the weather, this
woman must be taken across the Straits because
we are entirely without the proper appliances
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Screens were put around the cots as the
examination was made, so that the others
wouldn’t be harrowed by the sight of blood
or pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sick seemed to find comfort merely in
being able to describe their symptoms to a
wise, good man. Much of the trouble seemed
actually to evaporate as they talked to him.
Miss Dohme and the other nurses kept the
rooms spotlessly clean, and gay bowls of
buttercups were about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t feel nice, Doctor,” said the next
woman. “Some mornings a kind of dead,
dreary feeling seems to come out of me stummick
and go right down me laigs. Sometimes
it flutters; sometimes it lies down. The
wind’s wonderful strong today, and it’s
rising.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Usually the diagnosis is not greatly helped
by the patient, who meekly answers the questions
with “Yes, Doctor,” or “No, Doctor,”
or describes the symptoms with such poetic
vagueness that a great deal is left to the
imagination. It takes patient cross-questioning—in
which the Doctor is an adept—to elicit
the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here is a dear little baby, warmly muffled,
on the piazza with the elixir of the sun and the
pine air. The pustular eczema has been
treated with ammoniate of mercury—but what
will happen when the infant goes home to the
old malnutrition and want of sanitation? If
only the Doctor could follow the case!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bathtubs are a mystery to some of the patients,
who after they have been undressed
and led to the water’s edge ask plaintively,
“What do you want me to do now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So many times in this little hospital one was
smitten by the need of green vegetables which
in so many places are not to be had—“greens”
(like spinach), lettuce, radishes and
the rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we came away the Doctor spoke of the
feeling that he used to have that wherever a
battle for the right was on anywhere he must
take part in it. “But I have learned that they
also serve who simply do their duty in their
places. These dogs hereabouts seem to think
they must go to every fight there is, near or
far. But none of us is called upon to do all
there is to do. I often read of happenings in
distant parts of the earth and feel as though
I ought to be there in the thick of things.
Then I realize that if we all minded our own
business exactly where we are we’d be doing
well. And when such thoughts come to me I
just make up my mind to be contented and to
buckle down to my job all the harder.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span><h1>II<br/>A FISHER OF MEN</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>That evening Dr. Grenfell spoke in
the little Church of England, taking as
his text the words from the twelfth
chapter of John: “The spirit that is ruling in
this world shall be driven out.” Across the
tickle the huskies howled at the moon, and one
after another took up the challenge from either
bank. But one was no longer conscious of the
wailful creatures, and heard only the speaker;
and the kerosene lamps lighted one by one in
the gloom of the church became blurred stars,
and the woman sitting behind me in a loud
whisper said, “Yes! yes!” as Dr. Grenfell,
in the earnest and true words of a man
who speaks for the truth’s sake and not for
self’s sake, interpreted the Scriptures that he
has studied with such devotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I was young,” he said, “I learned
that man is descended from a monkey, and I
was told that there is no God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I became older and did my own
thinking I refused to believe that God chose
one race of mankind and left the rest to be
damned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one has the whole truth, whether he
be Church of England, Methodist or Roman
Catholic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The simple truth of Christianity is what
the world needs. How foolish seem the tinsel
and trumpery distinctions for which men
struggle! What is the use of being able to
string the alphabet along after your name?
Character is all that counts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some say that religion is for the saving
of your soul. But it is not a grab for the
prizes of this world, and the capital prize of
the life eternal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The things the world holds to be large,
Christ tells us, are small. Jesus says the
greatest things are truth and love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love is so big a thing that it forgets self
utterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many of us know what it is to love?
It is not mere animal desire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we all truly loved, what a world it
would be!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose a doctor loved all his patients.
He wouldn’t be satisfied then to say: ‘Your
leg is better,’ or ‘Here is a pill.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose a clergyman loved his people.
He wouldn’t say: ‘I wonder how many in this
congregation are Church of England.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God Himself is love and truth. Jesus
lived the beautiful things He taught. He was
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every man has something in him that
forces him to love what is unselfish and true
and altogether lovely and of good report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the war, in the midst of all the horror
and the terror and the pity of it, a noble spirit
was made manifest among men—a heroic
spirit of self-control and a sense of true
values.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I couldn’t have a palace I could have
a clean house; if I couldn’t speak foreign
languages I needn’t speak foul language. We
may be poor fishermen or poor London doctors:
we can serve in our places, and we can
let our lives shine before men. If I have
done my duty where I am, I don’t care about
the rest. I shall not care if they leave my
old body on the Labrador coast or at the bottom
of the Atlantic for the fishes, if I have
fought the good fight and finished the course.
Having lived well, I shall die contented.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as the service in the church was
over a meeting was held in the upper room of
the hospital. The room was filled, and Dr.
Grenfell spoke again. Before his address
familiar hymns were sung, and—noting that
two of those present had violins and were accompanying
the cabinet organ—he referred to
their efforts in his opening words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We all have the great duty and privilege
of common human friendliness,” he said.
“We may show it in the little things of every
day. For everybody needs help, everywhere.
There is no end to the need of human sympathy.
It may be shown with a fiddle—or
perhaps I ought to say ‘violin’ (apologizing
to a Harvard student who was officiating).</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have always loved Kim in Kipling’s story
of that name. Kim is just a waif. Nobody
knows who his father is; but he is called
‘the little friend of all the world.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a book which has found wide
acceptance called ‘Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage
Patch.’ Mrs. Wiggs lived in a humble cottage
with only her cabbage patch, but everybody
came to her for sunshine and healing.
She had plenty of troubles of her own, but
just because she had them she knew how to
help others. Whoever we are, whatever we
are, we may wear the shining armour of the
knights of God: there is work waiting for
our hands to do, there is good cheer for us
to spread.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dreamer and doer live side by side in amity
in Dr. Grenfell’s make-up. At the animated
dinner-table of the nurses and the doctors in
the Battle Harbour hospital, after asking a
blessing, he was talking eagerly about the
League of Nations, the industrial situation in
England and America and the future for
Russia while brandishing the knife above the
meat pie and letting no plate but his own go
neglected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Grenfell is happy and his soul is free
at the wheel of the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span>. That wheel
bears the words, “Jesus saith, Follow me and
I will make you fishers of men.” At the peak
of the mainmast is likely to be the blue pennant
bearing the words, “God is Love.” The
<span class='it'>Strathcona</span> is ketch-rigged. Her mainmast,
that is to say, is in the foremast’s place; and
above the mainsail is a new oblong topsail that
is the Doctor’s dear delight. The other sail
has above it a topsail of orthodox pattern, and
there are two jibs. So that when she has
her full fuel-saving complement of canvas
spread, the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span> displays six sails at
work. Could the Doctor always have his way,
all the sails would be up whenever a breeze
stirs. With a good wind the ship is capable
of eight knots and even more an hour: five
knots or so is her average speed under steam
alone. In the bow, his paws on the rail, or
out on the bowsprit sniffing the air and seeing
things that only he can see, is the incomparable
dog Fritz—Fritz of “57 varieties”—brown
and black, like toast that was burned
in the making. No one knows the prevailing
ancestry of Fritz, but a strain of Newfoundland
is suspected. He will take a chance on
swimming ashore if we cast anchor within
half a mile of it, though the water is near
congealment, and he knows that a pack of his
wolfish brethren is ready to dispute the shoreline
with him when he clambers out dripping
upon the stony beach with seaweed in his
hair. When he swims back to the ship again
his seal-like head is barely above the waves
as he paddles about, a mute appeal in his
brown eyes for a bight of rope to be hitched
about his body to help him aboard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Grenfell keeps unholy hours, and
dawn is one of his favourite out-door sports.
He may nominally have retired at twelve—which
is likely to mean that he began to read
a book at that hour. He may have risen at
two, three and four to see how the wind lay
and the sea behaved: and perhaps five o’clock
will find him at the wheel, bareheaded,
the wind ruffling the silver locks above his
ruddy countenance, his grey-brown eyes—which
are like the stone labradorite in the
varying aspects they take on—watching the
horizon, the swaying bowsprit, the compass,
and the goodness of God in the heavens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor is a great out-of-doors
man. He scorns a hat, and in his own
element abjures it utterly. He wears a brown
sweater, high in the neck, and above it he
smokes a briarwood pipe that is usually right
side up but appears to give him just as much
satisfaction when the bowl is inverted. The
rest of his costume is a symphony of grey or
brown, patched or threadbare but neat always,
ending in boots high or low of red rubber or
of leather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You may think that the dog Fritz out on
the bowsprit is enjoying all the morning there
is, but the Doctor is transformed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love these early mornings,” he says—and
he is innocent of pose when he says it:
it is not a mere literary emotion. “It’s a
beautiful sight in autumn with the ice when
the banks are red with the little hills clear-cut
against the sky and the sea a deep, deep
blue. Isn’t it a beautiful world to live in?
Isn’t it fun to live?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>You have to admit that it is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man can’t think just of stomachs all
the time. Sometimes I have to go away for
a day or two. But I can’t say when I’ve
ever been tired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A great little ship she is. She is very
human to me. She has done her bit—she
has carried her load. On that small deck and
down below we once took 56 Finns from the
wreck of the <span class='it'>Viking</span> off Hamilton Inlet. We
had nothing but biscuit and dry caplin on
which to feed them. Once we were caught in
a storm with seven schooners. We had 60
fathoms out on two chains for our anchors.
Six of the other seven ships went ashore.
Then the seventh overturned—ours was the
only ship that stood. All of a sudden our
main steampipe burst. We had to use cold
sea-water. It was a hard struggle to bring
our ship into shallow water at 1½ fathoms.
Another time we had to tow 19 small boats
at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We always have something up our sleeve
to get out of trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then suddenly spying other vessels with
their sails up, Dr. Grenfell proceeds to study
them for a lesson as to the way his own ship
is to take. He calls out to Albert Ash, his
pessimistic mate, “She’s well-ballasted, that
two-master. Have those others tacked?”
His talk runs on easily as he swings the ship
about and the sails are bellying with a favouring
breeze. “This wind’ll run out three knots.
I’m cheating it up into the wind. We’ll let
her go by a bit. This is Chimney Tickle in
here. A beautiful harbour. The tide and the
polar current meet here. It’s always open
water. It’s the place they’re thinking of for a
transatlantic harbour. It’s only 1,625 miles
from here to Galway. The jib and mainsail
aren’t doing the work. That man has no idea
of trimming a jib!” He rushes out to the
wheelhouse and does most of the work of
setting the mainsail himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so fond of those words ‘The sea is
His,’ ” he says, coming back to the spokes
again. “I think it runs in the blood. I like
to think of the old sea-dogs—like Frobisher
and Drake and Cabot. Shackleton told Mrs.
Grenfell that the first ship that came to Labrador
was named the <span class='it'>Grenfell</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The comings and goings of the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span>
mean much to these people,” said Dr.
McConnell. “At Independence a woman
met us on the wharf, the great tears rolling
down her cheeks. She lost her husband and
her son in the ‘flu’ epidemic. She told me that
her son said to her: ‘Mother, if Dr. Grenfell
were only here, he could save me.’ At Snack
Cove the people went out on the rocks and
cried bitterly when the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span> passed
them by—as we learned when to their great
relief we dropped in upon them a fortnight
later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We cast anchor at Pleasure Harbour because
of rough weather and for a few hours
had one of the Doctor’s all too infrequent
play-times, while waiting for the Strait to
abate its fury to permit of a possible crossing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here a delicious trout stream tumbled and
swirled from sullen, mist-hung uplands into a
piratical cove where two small schooners
swung at anchor. Like so many of these
places the cove was a complete surprise—you
came round the rock with no hint that it was
there till you found it, placid as a tarn and
deep and black, with big blue hills stretching
to the northward beyond the fuzzy fringes of
the nearer trees and the mottled barrens where
the clouds were poised and the ghosts of the
mist descended. (A tuneful, sailor-like name
it is that the Eskimoes give to a ghost—the
“Yo-ho”: and they say that the Northern
Lights are the spirits of the dead at play).</p>

<p class='pindent'>An unhandy person with a rod, I was
allowed by Dr. Grenfell and Dr. McConnell
to go ahead and spoil the nicest trout-pools
with my fly. Even though cod fishermen at
the mouth of the stream had unlawfully placed
a net to keep the trout from ascending, there
were plenty of trout in the brook, and in the
course of several hours forty-nine were good
enough to attach themselves to my line. The
banks were soggy under the long green
grass: the water was acutely cold: and in two
places there were small fields of everlasting
snow in angles of the rock. It was an ideal
trout-brook, for it was full of swirling black
eddies, rippling rapids, and deep, still pools.
The brook began at a lake which was roughened
by a wind blowing steadily toward us.
Dr. Grenfell cast against the wind where the
lake discharged its contents into the brook,
and the line was swept back to his boots.
With unwearying patience he cast again and
again, and while I strove in vain to land a
single fish from the lake he caught one monster
after another, almost at his own feet. All
the way up the brook he had successfully fished
in the most unpromising places, that we had
given over with little effort, and here he was
again getting by far the best results in the most
difficult places of all. There seemed to be a
parallel here with his medical and spiritual
enterprise on the Labrador. He has worked
for poor and humble people, when others have
asked impatiently: “Why do you throw
away your life upon a handful of fishermen
round about a bleak and uncomfortable island
where people have no business to live anyway?”
He could not leave the fishermen’s
stage at the mouth of the brook this time
without being called upon to examine a fisherman
troubled by failing eyesight. On the
run of a couple of hundred yards in a rowboat
to the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span> the thunder-clouds rolled up,
with lightning, and as we set foot on board
the deluge came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next evening found us at St. Anthony.
Doctors and nurses were on the wharf
to greet their chief after his absence
of several weeks. Dr. Curtis showed the
stranger through the clean and well-appointed
hospital, with its piazza for a sun-bath and
the bonny air for the T. B. patients, its X-ray
apparatus and its operating room, its small
museum of souvenirs of remarkable operations.
I saw Dr. Andrews of San Francisco
perform with singular deftness an operation
for congenital cataract, with a docile little girl
who had been blind a long time, and whose
sight would probably be completely restored by
the two thrusts made with a needle at the
sides of the cornea. Her eyes were bandaged
and she was carried away by the nurse,
broadly smiling, to await the outcome. For
ten years or so this noted oculist, no longer
young except in the spirit, has crossed the
continent to spend the summer in volunteer
service at St. Anthony—a fair type of the
men that are naturally drawn to the work in
which the Doctor found his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the St. Anthony doctors visiting
out-patients came upon a woman who was
carefully wrapped in paper. This explanation
was offered: “If us didn’t use he, the bugs
would lodge their paws in we.” “Bugs” are
flies, and the use of “he” for “it” is characteristic.
A skipper will talk about a lighthouse
as he, just as he feminizes a ship, and
the nominative case serves also as the
objective.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another woman had been wrapped by her
neighbours in burnt butter and oakum.
“Now give her a bath,” was Dr. Grenfell’s
advice after he had made his examination.
“You can if you like, Doctor,” the volunteer
nurse said. “If you do it and she dies we
shan’t be blamed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the hospital the Doctor was concerned
with a baby twelve months old whose
feet were twisted over till they were almost
upside down. The mother had massaged the
feet with oil for hours at a time. The baby
cried constantly with pain, and neither the
child nor the mother had known a satisfactory
night’s rest since it was born. When the
Doctor said the condition was curable, because
she had brought her child in time, the
look of relief in the mother’s face defied
recording. It is a look often seen with his
patients, and since he scarcely ever asks or
receives a fee worth mentioning, it constitutes
a large part of his reward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The herd of reindeer that the Doctor imported
from Lapland and installed between
St. Anthony and Flower’s Cove with two Lapp
herders are now flourishing under Canadian
auspices in (Canadian) Labrador in the
vicinity of the St. Augustine River. The
Doctor himself took a hand in the difficult job
of lassoing them and tying their feet, and
still there were about forty of the animals
that could not be found. The Doctor says
it was “lots of fun” catching them—but he
gives that description to many transactions
that most of us would consider the hardest
kind of hard work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next in importance after the hospital,
Exhibit A is the spick-and-span orphanage,
with thirty-five of the neatest and sweetest
children, polite and friendly and more than
willing to learn. The boys who are not named
Peter, James or John are named Wilfred.
“Suffer little children to come unto me” is
in big letters on the front of the building. On
the hospital is the inscription: “Faith, hope
and love abide, but the greatest of these is
love.” Over the Industrial School stands
written, “Whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as
unto the Lord.” Here the beautiful rugs are
made—hooked through canvas—according to
lively designs of Eskimoes and seals and polar
bears prepared in the main by the Doctor.
Even the bird-house has its legend: “Praise
the Lord, ye birds of wing.” There is a thriving
co-operative store, next door to the well-kept
little inn. A sign of the Doctor’s devising
and painting swings in front of the store. On
one side is a picture of huskies with a komatik
(sled) bringing boxes to a settler’s door, and
the inscription is, “Spot cash is always the
leader.” On the other side of the sign a ship
named <span class='it'>Spot Cash</span> is seen bravely ploughing
through mountainous waves and towering
bergs. Underneath it reads: “There’s no
sinking her.” “That is a reminiscence,”
smiled the Doctor, “of my fights with the
traders. Do you think these signs of mine
are cant? I don’t mean them that way. I
want every one of them to count.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A school, a laundry, a machine-shop and
a big store are other features of the plant at
St. Anthony. The dock is a double-decker,
and from it a diminutive tramway with a
hand-car sends “feeders” to the various
buildings and even up the walk to the Doctor’s
house. All the mail-boats now turn in at this
harbour. The captain of a ship like the
<span class='it'>Prospero</span>—which in the summer of 1919
brought on four successive trips 70, 70, 60 and
50 patients to overflow the hospital—appreciates
the facilities offered by this modern
wharfage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the Doctor goes about St. Anthony he
does not fail to note anything that is new,
or to bestow on any worthy achievement a
word of praise, for which men and women
work the harder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To “The Master of the Inn” he expressed
his satisfaction in the smooth-running, cleanly
hostelry. “He is one of my boys,” he remarked
to me after the conversation. “He
was trained here at St. Anthony, and then at
the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he meets the electrician. “Did you
get your ammeter?” he asks. And then:
“How did you make your rheostat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He points with satisfaction to a little Jersey
bull recently acquired, and then he critically
surveys the woodland paths that lead from his
dooryard to a tea-house on the hill commanding
the wide vista of the harbour and the
buildings of the industrial colony. “Nothing
of this when we came here,” he observes.
“The people seem possessed to cut down all
their trees: we do our best to save ours, and we
dote on these winding walks, which are an
innovation.” Then he laughs. “A good
woman heard me say that lambs were unknown
in Labrador, and that we had to speak
of seals instead when we were reading the
Scriptures. She sent me a lamb and some
birds, stuffed, so that the people might understand.
She meant well, but in transit the
lamb’s head got sadly twisted on one side, and
the birds were decrepit specimens indeed with
their bedraggled plumage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The house itself is delightful, and it is only
too bad that the Doctor and his wife see so
little of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a house with a distinct atmosphere.
The soul of it is the living-room with a wide
window at the end that opens out upon a
prospect of the wild wooded hillside, with an
ivy-vine growing across the middle, so that
it seems as if there were no glass and one could
step right out into the clear, pure air. There
is a big, hearty fireplace; there is a generously
receptive sofa; there is an upright Steinway
piano, where a blind piano-tuner was working
at the time of my visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lupins, the purple monk’s hood and the
pink fireweed grow along the paths and about
the house. A glass-enclosed porch surrounds
it on three sides, and in the porch are antlered
heads of reindeer and caribou, coloured views
of scenery in the British Isles and elsewhere,
snowshoes and hunting and fishing paraphernalia,
a great hanging pot of lobelias, and—noteworthily—a
brass tablet bearing this
inscription:</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is the kind of house that eloquently
speaks of being lived in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is comfortable, but the note of idle luxury
or useless ostentation is absent. There is no
display for its own sake. The books bear
signs of being fireside companions. Dr.
Grenfell is fond of running a pencil down the
margin as he reads. He is very fond of the
books of his intimate friend Sir Frederick
Treves, in whose London hospital he was
house-surgeon. “The Land that is Desolate”
was aboard the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span>. Millais’ book on
Newfoundland was on the writing desk at
St. Anthony, and had been much scored, as,
indeed, had many of his other books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I asked him to name to me his favourite
books. Offhand he said: “The Bible first,
naturally. And I’m very fond of George
Borrow’s ‘The Bible in Spain.’ I admire Borrow’s
persistence until he sold a Testament in
Finisterre. ‘L’Avengro’ and ‘Romany Rye’
are splendid, too. I’m very fond of Kipling’s
‘Kim.’ Then I greatly care for the lives of
men of action. Autobiography is my favourite
form of reading. The ‘Life of Chinese Gordon’—the
‘Life of Lord Lawrence’—the
‘Life of Havelock.’ You see there is a strong
strain of the Anglo-Indian in my make-up.
My family have been much concerned with
colonial administration in India. The story
of Outram I delight in. He was everything
that is unselfish and active—and a first-class
sportsman. Boswell’s ‘Johnson’ is a great
favourite of mine. I take keen pleasure in
Froude’s ‘Seamen of the 16th Century.’ In
the lighter vein I read every one of W. W.
Jacob’s stories. Mark Twain is a great man.
What hasn’t he added to the world!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then there is ‘Anson’s Voyages.’ It’s a
capital book. He describes how he lugged off
two hundred and ten old Greenwich pensioners
to sail his ships, though they frantically fled
in every direction to avoid being impressed
into the service. All of them died, and he
lost all of his ships but the one in which he
fought and conquered a Spanish galleon after
a most desperate battle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I used to have over my desk the words
of Chinese Gordon:</p>

<p class='line0'>To do the will of God,’</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>and the rest of his creed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The only man whose picture is in my Bible
is the Rev. Jeremiah Horrox, a farmer’s
son. He was the first to observe the transit
of Venus. That was in 1640. The picture
shows him watching the phenomenon through
the telescope. It inspired me to think what a
poor lonely clergyman could accomplish. He
and men like him stick to their jobs—that’s
what I like.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have in my Bible the words of Pershing
to the American Expeditionary Force in
France in 1917—the passage beginning
‘Hardship will be your lot.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was privileged to look into that Bible. It
is the Twentieth Century New Testament
This he likes, he says, because the vernacular
is clear, and sheds light on disputed passages
which are not clear in other versions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I care more for clearness than anything
else,” he declared. “When I read to the
fishermen I want them to understand every
word. But I have often read from this version
to sophisticated congregations in the United
States and had persons afterwards ask me
what it was. Many passages are positively
incorrect in the King James Version. For
instance, the eighth chapter of Isaiah, which is
the first lesson for Christmas morning, is
misleading in the Authorized Version.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We debated the relative merits of the King
James Version and the Twentieth Century
Version for a long time one evening. I was
holding out for the old order, in the feeling that
the revised text deliberately sacrificed much of
the majestic beauty and poetry of the style of
the King James Version and that—despite an
occasional archaism—the meaning was clear
enough, and the additional accuracy did not
justify putting aside the earlier beloved translation.
Dr. Grenfell earnestly insisted that
the most important thing is to make the meaning
of the Scriptures plain to plain people—that
the sense is the main consideration, and
the truth is more important than a stately
cadence of poetic prose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want the language of three hundred
years ago,” he asserted. “I want the
language of today.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is his custom to crowd the margins of his
Bibles with annotations. He fills up one copy
after another—one of these is in the possession
of Mrs. John Markoe of Philadelphia, who
prizes it greatly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the name of George Borrow and the
picture of Jeremiah Horrox on the fly-leaf of
the copy he now uses, he has written “My
inspirers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is much interleaving and all the inserted
pages are crowded with trenchant
observations and reflections on the meaning
of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adhering to the inner side of the front
corner is a poem:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pages of meditation are given to dreams—service—conversion—going
to the war in 1915
with the Harvard Medical Unit—the place of
religion in daily life—the will—the religion
of duty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another clipping—in large print—bears the
words: “Not to love, not to serve, is not to

<p class='pindent'>In the back of the book is pasted an extended
description of the death of Edith
Cavell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In one place he writes: “I don’t want a
squashy credulity weakening my resolution
and condoning incompetency—but just a faith
of optimism which is that of youth and makes
me do things regardless of the consequences.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His marginal annotations disclose the profound
and the devoted student of the Bible—the
man who without the slightest shred of
mealy-mouthed sanctimoniousness searches
the Scriptures, and lives close to the spirit of
the Master. Anyone who sees even a little
of Grenfell in action must realize how faithful
his life is to the pattern of Christ’s life on
earth. There are many passages of Christ’s
experience—as when the crowd pressed in
upon Him—or when learned men were supercilious—or
when He perceived that virtue
had gone out of Him—or when He was
reproached because He let a man die in His
absence—that remind one of Grenfell’s
thronged and hustled life. Many believe that
Grenfell can all but work a miracle of healing;
and the lame, the halt and the blind are brought
to him from near and far, at all times of the
day or the night, even as they were brought to
the Master. In his love of children, in his
patience with the doer of good and his
righteous wrath aflame against the evil-doer, in
his candour and his sunny sweetness and his
unfailing courage Grenfell translates the
precepts of the Book into the action and the
speech of the living way. He cannot live by
empty professions of faith; he is happy only
when he is putting into vivid practice the creed
which guides his living.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span><h1>IV<br/>ALL IN THE DAY’S WORK</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It was hard to say where the Doctor’s
day began or ended. One night he rose
several times to inspect wind and weather
ere deciding to make a start; and at twenty
minutes before five he was at the wheel himself.
Mrs. Grenfell clipped from “Life” and
pinned upon his tiny stateroom mirror a
picture of a caterpillar showing to a class of
worms the early bird eating the worm. The
legend beneath it ran: “Now remember, dear
children, the lesson for today—the disobedient
worm that would persist in getting up too early
in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His books and articles are usually written
between the early hours of five and seven
o’clock in the morning. The log of the
<span class='it'>Strathcona</span>, religiously kept for the information
of the International Grenfell Association,
was likely to be pencilled on his knee
while sitting on a pile of firewood on the
reeling deck. Just as Roosevelt wrote his
African game-hunting articles “on safari,”
while so wearied with the chase that he could
hardly keep his eyes open, the Doctor has
schooled himself to do his work without considering
his pulse-beat or his temperature or
his blood pressure. After a driving day afloat
and ashore, as surgeon, magistrate, minister
and skipper, he rarely retires before midnight,
and often he sits up till the wee small hours
engrossed in the perusal of a book he likes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Doctor enters a harbour unannounced
and drops anchor, within a few
minutes power-boats and rowboats are flocking
about the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span>, and the deck fills
with fishermen, their wives and their children,
all with their major and minor troubles.
Sometimes it requires the whole family to
bring a patient. Often after a diagnosis it
seems advisable to place a patient in the hospital
at Battle Harbour or St. Anthony, and
so the “Torquay Cot” or another in the
diminutive hospital on the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span> is filled,
or perhaps the passenger goes to hob-nob with
the good-natured crew and consume their
victuals. Many a crying baby, in the limited
space, makes the narrow quarters below-decks
reverberate with the heraldry of the fact that
he is teething or has the tummyache.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor operates at the foot of the
companion-ladder leading down into the
saloon, which is dining-room, living-room and
everything else. “I always have a basin of
blood at the foot of the ladder,” he grimly
remarks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told him I thought I would call what I
wrote about him “From Topsails to Tonsils,”
since with such versatility he passed from the
former to the latter. “That reminds me,” he
said with a laugh, “of the time I went ashore
with Dr. John Adams, and the first thing we
did was to lay three children out on the table
and remove their tonsils. That was a mighty
bloody job, I can tell you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hatchway over his head as he operates
is always filled with the heads of so many
spectators—including frequently the Doctor’s
dog, Fritz—that the meagre light which
comes from above is nearly shut off. Often
a lamp is necessary, and as electric flash-lamps
are notoriously faithless in a crisis, it is usually
a kerosene lamp. Often an impatient patient
starts to come down before his time, or an
over-eager parent or husband thinks he must
accompany the one that he has brought for
the doctor’s lancet. It is hard to get elbow-room
for the necessary surgery, and every
operation is a more or less public clinical
demonstration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Usually the description of the symptoms is
of the vaguest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m chilled to the cinders,” said an
anxious Irishman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we can put on some fresh coal,”
was the Doctor’s answer. “How old are
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forty-six, Doctor!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A mere child!” the doctor replies, and
the merry twinkle in his eyes brings an answering
smile to the face of the sufferer.
The Doctor himself was fifty-five years old in
February, 1920.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So many fishermen get what are called
“water-whelps” or “water-pups,”—pustules
on the forearm due to the abrasion of the
skin by more or less infected clothing. Cleaning
the cod and cutting up fish produces many
ugly cuts and piercings and consequent sores,
and there is always plenty of putrefying
matter about a fishing-stage to infect them.
So that a very common phenomenon is a great
swelling on the forearm—and an agonizing,
sleep-destroying one it may be—where pus
has collected and is throbbing for the lance.
It is a joy to witness the immediate relief that
comes from the cutting, and as the iodine is
applied and deft fingers bandage the wound
the patient tries to find words to tell of his
thankfulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One afternoon just as the Doctor thought
there was a lull in the proceedings four
women and a man came over the rail at once.
The first woman had a “bad stummick”; the
second wanted “turble bad” to have her tooth
“hauled”; the third had “a sore neck, Miss”
(thus addressing Mrs. Grenfell); the fourth
woman had something “too turble to tell”;
the man merely wanted to see the Doctor on
general principles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here is a bit of dialogue with a woman who
couldn’t sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you do when you don’t sleep?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I bide in the bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you do any work?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you cook?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you wash the children?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Scattered times, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the husband put in: “She couldn’t do
her work and it overcast her. She overtopped
her mind, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a fine, dignified old fellow, and it
was a real pleasure to see how tender he was
toward his poor fidgety, neurasthenic spouse.
She hadn’t any teeth worth mentioning, and
her lips were pursed together with a vise-like
grip. I shall not forget how Doctor Grenfell
murmured to me in a humorous aside:
“Teeth certainly do add to a lady’s charm!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When medicine is administered, it is hard
to persuade the afflicted one that the prescription
means just what it says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This lady was told to take three pills, and
she took two. But most of them exceed their
instruction. To a woman at Trap Cove Dr.
Fox gave liniment for her knee. It helped her.
Then she took it internally for a stomach-ache,
arguing logically enough that a pain is a pain,
a medicine is a medicine, and if this liniment
was good for a hurt in the knee it must be
good for any bodily affliction. Luckily she
lived to tell the tale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I was in the North Sea the sailors
if they got the chance ransacked my medicine
cupboard and drank up everything they could
lay their hands on.” Such autobiographic
confessions are often made while the Doctor
mixes a draught or concocts a lotion. “Here
it is the same way. I have had my customers
drain off the whole bottle of medicine at once,
on the theory that if one teaspoonful did you
good, a bottle would be that much better.”
His questions, like his lancet, go right to
the root of the trouble. Nothing phases him.
He answers every question. He never tells
people they are fools; his inexhaustible forebearance
with the inept and the obtuse is not
the least Christlike of his attributes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is difficult for these men to come to the
hospital in summer, for their livelihood depends
on their catch, and then on their salting
and spreading the fish: and after the cod-fishery
has fallen away to zero the herring
come in October, and the cod to some extent
return with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I tell them they must go to the
hospital, they always say ‘I haven’t time: I
want to stay and mind my traps.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor hates above all things—as I
have indicated—to leave a wound open, or
a malady half-treated, and hustle on. It is
the great drawback and exasperation in his
work that the interval before he sees the
patient again must be so long. He mourns
whenever he has to pull a tooth that might be
saved if he could wait to fill it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He is always working against time, against
the sea, against ignorance, against a want of
charity on the part of nominal Christians who
ought to help him instead of carping and
denouncing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he is working with all honest and
sincere men, all who are true to the high
priesthood of science, all who are on the side
of the angels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One man thus describes his affliction, letting
the Doctor draw his own deductions:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like a little round ball the pain will start,

rest I get is to crumple meself down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An unhappy woman reciting the history of
her complaint declared: “The last doctor
said I had an impression of the stomach and
was full of glams.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless God!” exclaimed another, speaking
of her children. “There’s nothing the matter
with ’em. They be’s off carrying wood. They
just coughs and heaves, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One mother, asked what treatment she was
administering to her infant replied: “Oh, I
give ’er nothing now. Just plenty of cold
water and salts and spruce beer; ne’er drop
o’ grease.”</p>

<p class='caption'>BATTLE HARBOUR—SPREADING FISH FOR DRYING.</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Elemental human misery made itself heard
in the dolorous accents of a corpulent lady of
fifty. “I works in punishment on account of
my eyes. Sometimes I piles two or three fish
on top of each other and I has to do it over.
I cries a good deal about it.” Her gratification
as she was fitted to a pair of “plus”
glasses that greatly improved her sight was
worth a long journey to witness. Many pairs
of glasses were put on her nose en route to the
discovery of the most satisfactory pair, and
each time she would say “Lovely! Beautiful!”
with crescendo of fervour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I heard a fond father tell the Doctor that
there was a “rale squick (real squeak) bawling
on the inside of” his offspring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man who climbed down the companion
way with an aching side, a rupture, and a
hypertrophic growth on his finger, was asked
what he did for his ribs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I rinsed them,” was the response.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor is always on the lookout for
the “first flag of warning”—as he calls it—of
the dreaded “T. B.” which is responsible
for one death in every four in Newfoundland.
Much of his talk with a patient has to do with
fresh air and fresh vegetables. The Eskimoes
may know better than some native Newfoundlanders.
“I like air. I push my whiphandle
through the roof,” said one of the Eskimoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here is a typical excerpt, from a conversation
with a young man who to the layman
looked very robust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How old are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty-two, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have any in your family had tuberculosis?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father’s brother Will and Aunt Clarissa
died of it, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you suffering?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It shoots up all through my stomach, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you read and write?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Doctor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See clearly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Doctor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you able to get any greens?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dock-leaves?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What greens have you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alexander greens, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any berries?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Doctor. And bake apples.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s good. You must eat plenty of
them. You must have good food. As good
as you can afford. I’m sorry it’s so hard
where you live to get anything fresh. Do you
sleep well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Doctor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anybody else sleep in the same bed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Doctor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you go to bed do you keep the
windows open?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Doctor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right. That’s very important. Do
people spit around you?” (The Doctor is
always on the war-path against this disgusting
and dangerous habit.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite sure?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we use spit-boxes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you burn the contents?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you wear warm things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Doctor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sweat a lot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Doctor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t get wet without changing
your clothes. Now, when you eat potatoes I
want you to eat them baked, with the skins
on. I don’t mean eat the skins. But the part
right under the skins is very important.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Doctor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As one listens to such catechizing it becomes
clear that the Doctor lays great stress
on fresh air and fresh food as medicines,
“Cold is your friend and heat is your enemy”
is his oft-reiterated dictum to consumptives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once he said to me, “I attach great importance
to the sun-bath. I believe in exposing
the naked body to all it can get of the air.”
In the nipping cold of the early morning on
the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span> I emerged from beneath four
double blankets to hear the Doctor joyfully
cry: “I’ve just had my bucket on deck. You
could have had one too, but I lost the bucket
overboard.” It has been a pastime of his to
row with a boatload of doctors and nurses to
an iceberg and go in swimming from the platform
at the base of the berg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes the Macedonian cry comes by
letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here is a pencilled missive from an old
woman who evidently got a kindly neighbour
to write it for her, for the signature is misspelled:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pleas ducker grandlield would you help
me with a little clothing I am a wodow 85 yars

<p class='pindent'>“Grandlield” is not further from the name
than a great many have come. Here are some
other common variants:</p>

<p class='pindent'>From a village in White Bay, where the
fishing was woefully poor in 1919, comes this
pathetic plea:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Dr. and Mrs. Grenfell: Dear Friends:
I am writing to see if you will help me a little.—My
husband got about 1 qtl of fish (1 quintal—pronounced
kental—of 112 pounds,
worth at most $11.20) this summer, and I have
four children, 15, 13, 11, 6 years, and his
Father, and we are all naked as birds with no
ways or means to get anything. What can I
do; if you can do anything for me I hope
God will bless you. It is pretty hard to look
at a house full of naked children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Grenfell visited White Bay in July and
in two villages found a number of people all
but utterly destitute. They were living on
“loaf” (bread) and tea. They had icefields
instead of fish. Six of the breadwinners got
a job at St. Anthony. The villagers had few
pairs of shoes among them, In several instances
the foot-gear was fashioned of the
sides of rubber boots tied over the feet with
pieces of string. The people of this neighbourhood
are folk of the highest character, and
richly deserving, though poverty-stricken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another characteristic letter:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dr. dear sir. please send two roals fielt
(rolls of felt) one Roal Ruber Hide (rubberoid)

<p class='pindent'>“dr—dear sir I want some nails to finesh
the farm fance I farn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a fisherman’s house in an interval between
examinations of children for tonsils and
adenoids the Doctor related this incident to a
spellbound group. He never has any trouble
holding an audience with stories that grow out
of his work, and the fishermen delight as he
does in his informal chats with them and with
their families.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had a long hunt for a starving family
of which we had been told by the Hudson Bay
Company agent, on an island at Hamilton
Inlet in Labrador. The father was half
Eskimo. He had a single-barrelled shotgun
with which he had brought down one gull.
With his wife and his five naked children he
was living under a sail. The children, though
they had nothing on, were blue in the face
with eating the blueberries, and they were fat
as butter. The mate took two of the little ones,
as if they were codfish, one under each arm,
and carried them aboard. There were tears
in his eyes, for he had seven little ones of his
own, and he was very fond of children. Both
were carefully brought up at our Childrens’
Home and one of them, who can now both
read and write, is aboard at present as a member
of the crew of the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After evening prayers on Sunday, at which
the Doctor has spoken, he has treated as many
as forty persons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In one place after removing a man’s tonsils
it was a case of eyeglasses to be fitted, then
came one who clamoured to have three teeth
extracted. The teeth were “hauled” and a
bad condition of ankylosis at the roots was
revealed. Then a girl had a throat abscess
lanced, and she was followed by a boy with
a dubious rash and a tubercular inheritance.
The Doctor is ever on the lookout for the
“New World” smallpox: but the stethoscope
detected a pleuritic attack, and strong supporting
bandages were wound about the lower part
of his chest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another group was this:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. An operation on a child’s tonsils. A
local anaesthetic was given—10 per cent. cocaine.
A tooth was also removed. The total
charge was $1.00.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. A fisherman came for ointments—zinc
oxide and carbolic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. An eight months old infant was brought
in, blind in the right eye. This condition
might have been obviated had boric acid been
applied at the time of the baby’s birth. The
mother said that only a little warm water had
been used.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So many, though they may not say so, appear
to believe with Mary when she said to
Jesus, “Lord, if thou hadst been here my
brother had not died.” They think the Doctor
has something like supernatural powers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the utmost care he prepared to administer
novocaine and treat the wound of a
man who had run a splinter into his left hand
between the first and second fingers, leaving
an unhealed sinus. “Wonderful stuff, this
novocaine!” he remarked, as he put on a pair
of rubber gloves, washed them in alcohol, and
then gave his knives a bath in a soup-plate
of alcohol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the inflamed parts none of these local
anaesthetics work very well,” was his next
comment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the patient scarcely felt it when he ran
a probe through the hand till it all but protruded
through the skin on the inner side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bad blood was spooned out, and then
the deep cavity swallowed about six inches of
iodoform gauze. When the wound had been
carefully packed the hand was bandaged. For
nearly an hour’s work requiring the exercise of
rare skill and the utmost caution the charge
was—a dollar. And that included a pair of
canvas gloves and another pair of rubber mitts,
of the Doctor’s own devising, drawn over the
bandages and tied so that the man might continue
at his work without getting salt-water
or any contaminating substance in the wound
and so infecting it badly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These two importunate telegrams arrived
while he was paying a flying visit to headquarters
at St. Anthony:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Do your best to come and operate me I
have an abscess under right tonsil will give you
coal for your steamer am getting pretty weak.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>Capt. J. N. Coté, Long Point.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A second telegram arriving almost simultaneously
from the same man read: “Please
come as fast as you can to operate me in the
throat and save my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Coté is the keeper of the Greenly
Island Lighthouse, near Blanc Sablon. It is
a very important station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor, true to form, at once made up
his mind to go. Greenly Island is about 100
miles from St. Anthony, and on the opposite
side of the Straits, on the Canadian side of
the line that divides Canadian Labrador from
Newfoundland Labrador. The short cut took
us through Carpoon (Quirpon) Tickle, and
there we spent the night, for much as the Doctor
wanted to push ahead the wind made the
Strait so rough that—having it against us—the
<span class='it'>Strathcona</span> could not have made headway.
“I remember,” said the Doctor with a smile,
“that once we steamed all night in Bonavista
Bay, full speed ahead, and in the morning
found ourselves exactly where we were the
night before. Coal is too scarce now.” On
one occasion the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span> distinguished herself
by going ashore with all sails set.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the earliest light of morning we were
under way. The tendency of a land-lubber at
the wheel off this cruel coast was naturally to
give the jagged and fearsome spines of rock
as wide a berth as possible. In the blue distance
might be seen a number of bergs, large
and small, just as a reminder of what the ice
can do to navigation when it chooses; and in
the foreground were fishermen’s skiffs bobbing
about and taking their chances of crossing the
track of our doughty little steamer. But the
Doctor called in at the door of the wheelhouse:
“Run her so close to those rocks that
you almost skin her!” He was thinking not
of his ship, not of himself, but of the necessity
of getting to the lonely lighthouse-keeper at
the earliest possible moment, to perform that
operation for a subtonsillar abscess. There
was a picture in his mind of the valiant French
Canadian engineer gasping for breath as the
orifice dwindled, and now he was burning not
the firewood but coal—a semi-precious stone
in these waters in this year of grace. The
<span class='it'>Strathcona</span> labours and staggers; Fritz the dog
goes to the bowsprit and sniffs the sun by day
and the moon by night; the ship is carrying
all the bellying sails she has; and the Doctor
mounts to the crow’s-nest to make sure that
his beloved new topsail is doing its full share.
He tools the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span>—when he is at the
wheel—as if she were a taxicab. So the long
diagonal across the Strait is cut down, seething
mile by mile, till between Flower’s Cove
and Forteau—where the Strait is at the
narrowest, and the shores are nine miles and
three-quarters apart—it almost seems as if an
hour’s swim on either hand would take one
to the eternal crags where the iris blows and
the buttercup spreads her cloth of gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We drew near Blanc Sablon (pronounced
Sablow) with Grant’s Wharf by the river.
West of that river for several hundred yards
it is no man’s land between the two Labradors—that
is to say, between Canada and Newfoundland.
A man stood up in a jouncing
power-boat and waved an oar, and then—his
overcoat buttoned up to his ears—our patient,
Captain Coté, stood up beside him. They had
come out to meet us to save every moment of
precious time. It was a weak and pale and
shaky man that came aboard—but he was a
man every bit of him, and he did not wince
when the Doctor, in the crypt-like gloom of
the <span class='it'>Strathcona’s</span> saloon, while the tin lamp was
held in front of the Captain’s mouth, reached
into the throat with his attenuated tongs and
scissors and made the necessary incision after
giving him several doses of the novocaine solution
as a local anaesthetic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then the Captain sat back white and gasping
on the settle, and—with a strong Canadian
French flavour in his speech—told us a little
of his lonely vigil of the summer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In eighteen days, Doctor, I never saw a
ship for the fog: but I kept the light burning—two
thousand gallons of kerosene she
took.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All summer long it was fog—fog—fog.
I show you by the book I keep. Ever since
the ice went out we have the fog. Five days
we have in July when it was clear—but never
such a clear day as we have now. Come
ashore with me on Greenly Island and you
shall have the only motor car ride it would be
possible for you to have in Labrador.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We accepted the invitation. At the head of
the wharf were men spreading the fish to
dry—grey-white acres of them on the flakes
like a field of everlastings. In the lee of a
hill they had a few potato-plants, fenced away
from the dogs. In a dwelling house with
“Please wipe your feet” chalked on the door
we found a spotless kitchen and two fresh-cheeked,
white-aproned women cooking. It
was a fine thing to know that they were upholding
so high a standard of cleanliness and
sanitation in that lonely outpost—as faithful
as the keeper of the light in his storm-defying
tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the fish-flakes of the ancient “room”
over half a mile of cinderpath and planking
we rode on the chassis of a Ford car, which
the keeper uses to convey supplies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The first joy-ride I ever had in Labrador,”
said the Doctor, and the Captain grinned and
let out another link to the roaring wind that
flattened the grass and threatened to lift his
cabbage-plants out of their paddock under his
white housewalls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Safe in his living-room, with wife and children,
two violins, a talking-machine, an
ancient Underwood typewriter and even a
telephone that connected him with the wharf,
Captain Coté pulled out his wallet, selected
three ten-dollar bills and offered them to the
Doctor, saying: “I will pay you as much more
as you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Grenfell took one of the bills, saying,
“That will be enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Captain, mindful of his promise about
the coal, said, “How much coal do you
want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the understanding that the Canadian
Government supplies it,” answered the Doctor,
“I will let you put aboard the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span>
just the amount we used in coming here—5½
tons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Captain went to the telephone and
talked with a man at the wharf. Then he
turned away from the transmitter and said:
“He tells me that he can’t put the coal on
board today, because it would blow away while
they were taking it out to the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span> on
the skiff. We have no sacks to put it in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” returned the Doctor, “when
it’s convenient you might store it at Forteau.
They will need it there this winter at Sister
Bailey’s nursing station.” Then he dismissed
the subject of the fee and the fuel-supply
to tell us how pleased he was to find
that Mackenzie King, author of “Industry and
Humanity,” had become the Liberal leader in
Canada. King is a Harvard Doctor of
Philosophy, a man of thought and action of
the type by nature and training in sympathy
with Grenfell’s work. It is a great thing for
Canada that a man of his calibre and scholarly
distinction has been raised to the place he
holds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the site of the lighthouse there are
observed most singular wide shelves of smooth
brown rock presenting their edges to the fury
of the surf, and over the broad brown expanse
are scattered huge boulders that look
as though the Druids who left the memorials
at Stonehenge might have put them there.
Captain Coté said the winter ice-pack tossed
these great stones about as if it were a child’s
game with marbles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A happy man he thought himself to have his
children with him. The lighthouse-keeper at
Belle Isle lost six of his family on their way
to join him; another at Flower’s Cove lost
five. As a remorseless graveyard of the deep
the region is a rival of the dreaded Sable
Island off Newfoundland’s south shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A wire rope indicates the pathway of two
hundred yards between the light and the foghorn:
and in winter the way could not be
found without it. The foghorn gave a solo
performance for our benefit, at the instigation
of either member of a pair of Fairbanks-Morse
15 horse-power gasoline engines.
We were ten feet from it, but it can be heard
ten miles and more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A “keeper of the light” like Captain Coté,
or Peter Bourque, who tended the Bird Rock
beacon for twenty-eight years, is a man after
Grenfell’s own heart. For Grenfell himself
lets his light shine before men, and knows the
need of keeping the flame lambent and bright,
through thick and thin.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span><h1>V<br/>THE CAPTAIN OF INDUSTRY</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Grenfell in his battles with
profiteering traders has incurred their
enmity, of course—but he has been
the people’s friend. The favourite charge
of those who fight him is that he is amassing
wealth for himself by barter on the side, and
collecting big sums in other lands from which
he diverts a golden stream for his own uses.
The infamous accusation is too pitifully lame
and silly to be worth denying. The most unselfish
of men, he has sometimes worked his
heart out for an ingrate who bit the hand that
fed him. His enterprise, whose reach always
exceeds his grasp, is money-losing rather than
money-making.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The International Grenfell Association has
never participated in the trading business. Dr.
Grenfell, however, started several stores with
his own money and took it out after a time
with no interest. He delights in the success
of those whose aim is no more than a just
profit, who buy from the fisherman at a fair
price and sell to him in equity. There is a
co-operative store of his original inspiration
and engineering at Flower’s Cove, and another
is the one at Cape Charles, which in five years
returned 100 per cent. on the investment with
5 per cent. interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accusations of graft he is accustomed to
face, and a commission appointed by the Newfoundland
Legislature investigated him,
travelled with him on the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span>, and completely
exonerated him. Some persons had
even gone so far as to accuse him of making
money out of the old clothes business aboard
what they were pleased to term his “yacht.”
They descended to such petty false witness as
to swear that he had taken a woman’s dress
with $12 in it. It is wearisome to have to
dignify such charges by noticing them. They
are about on a par with the letter of a bishop
who wrote to him: “I should like to know
how you can reconcile with your conscience
reading a prayer in the morning against
heresy and schism, and then preaching at a
dissenting meeting-house in the afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A vestryman objected to his preaching in
the church at a diminutive and forlorn settlement
because “he talks about trade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor is never embittered by his traducers.
He knows the meaning of J. L.
Garvin’s saying, “He who is bitter is beaten.”
Nothing beclouds for long his sunny temperament,
but his unfailing good-humour
never dulls the fighting edge of his courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I bought a boat for a worthy soul, to set
him on his feet,” the Doctor told me. “She
had been driven ashore in North Labrador. I
had to buy everything separately—and the
total came to $500. The boat was to work
out the payment. This she did—Alas! later
on she went ashore on Brehat (‘Braw’)
Shoals. Only her lifeboat came ashore, with
the name—<span class='it'>Pendragon</span>—upon it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor put $1,000 of his money into
the co-operative store at Flower’s Cove, and
when the enterprise was fairly launched and
the Grenfell Association decided to abstain
from lending help to trade he drew it out, and
asked no interest. That store in its last fiscal
year sold goods to the value of more than
$200,000, paying fair prices and selling at a
fair profit. It had three ships in the summer
of 1919 carrying fish abroad—“foreigners.”
The proprietor bought for $50 a schooner that
went ashore at Forteau, dressed it in a new
suit of sails worth $1,250, and now has a
craft worth $8,000 to him. Dr. Grenfell has
personally great affection for some of the
traders—it is the “truck system” he hates.
“Trading in the old days,” the Doctor observes,
“was like a pond at the top of a hill.
It got drained right out. The money was not
set in circulation here on the soil of Newfoundland.
The traders in two months took
away the money that should have been on the
coast. 1919 was the first year in which the
co-operative stores themselves sent fish to the
other side. A vessel from Iceland came here
to the Flower’s Cove store; another was a
Norwegian; a third came from Cadiz with
salt; and today a small vessel is preparing to
go across.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Red Bay is another store to which
Dr. Grenfell loaned money, which he drew
out, sans interest, when it was prosperous. It
has saved the people there, as every soul in
the harbour will testify.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fishermen on the West Coast in 1919
enjoyed something like affluence as compared
with their brethren on the East Coast, where
the fish were scarce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Where there were lobsters, they were
getting $35.50 or $35.00 per case of 48 one-pound
cans. For cod, $11.20 a quintal of 112
pounds was paid. In 1918 over $15 per quintal
was paid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other hand, with pork at $100 a
barrel, coal at $24 a ton, and gasoline at 70
cents a gallon, the big prices for fish were
matched by an alarming cost of the necessaries
of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some fishermen make but $200 a year; a
few make as much as $2,000 and even more.
The merchant princes as a rule are the store-keepers
who deal with the fishermen. There
were two big bank failures in St. John’s years
ago, and since that time many persons have
hidden their money in the ground. One
fisherman of whose case I heard had but $35
in cash as the result of his season’s effort, and
he had eight to support besides himself. The
small amount of ready money on which people
can live with a house, a vegetable garden, and
a supply of firewood at their backs in the
timbered hillsides is unbelievable. If a man
was fortunate enough to possess any grassland,
he might get as much as $65 a ton for
his hay in 1919, if he could spare it from his
own cows and sheep. It is too bad that for
the sake of the sheep the noble Newfoundland
dog that chased them has had to perish. It
is almost impossible today to find a pure-breed
example of the dog that spread the name of
the island to the ends of the earth. Such dogs
as there are are remarkably intelligent and
make excellent messengers between a man at
work and his house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “Southerners” go to the Grand Banks
for their fishing; the others go to the Labrador.
The three classes of fishermen are the shore
fishermen, the “bankers,” and the “floaters”—those
of the Labrador. Ordinarily the
catch is reckoned by quintals (pronounced
kentals) of 112 pounds. Those who live on
the Labrador coast the winter through are
known as the “liveyers”—the live-heres—and
those who come regularly to the fishing are
“stationers” or “planters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the war big prices have been realized
for the fish, and unprecedented prosperity has
come to the fishermen. The growth in the
number of motor-boats is an index of this
condition, though with gasoline at 70 cents a
gallon on the Labrador (for the imperial
gallon, slightly larger than ours), the question
of fuel has been a disturbing one to many. Of
late much of the fish has been marketed on
favourable terms in the United States and
Canada, but before this the preferred markets
in order have been Spain and Portugal, Brazil
and the West Indies. The three grades
recognized, from the best to the lowest, are
“merchantable,” “Madeira,” and “West Indies”
(“West Injies”), the last-named for
the negroes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An industry of growing importance to the
future of the Grenfell mission is the manufacture
and sale of “hooked” rugs by the
women trained at the industrial school at St.
Anthony. Large department stores in the
United States have begun to buy these rugs
in considerable quantities, and the demand is
lively and increasing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor’s delightful sense of humour
comes to the fore in his designs for these
rugs, made of rags worked through canvas.
The dyes are vivid green, blue, red, black,
brown—the white rivals the driven snow, and
the workmanship is of the best. A favourite
pattern shows the dogs harnessed to the
komatik eager to be off, turning in the traces
as if to ask questions of the driver, their attitude
alert and alive, while their two masters
standing by the baggage on the komatik, in
hoods and heavy parkas (blouses) rimmed
with red and blue, are discussing the route to
take and pointing with their mittened hands.
Or the design may show Eskimoes stealthily
stalking polar bears upon an ice-pan of a
wondrous green at the edges. There is a
glorious Turnerian sunset in the background;
the sea bristles with bergs arched and pinnacled.
The wary hunters approach their
hapless quarry in a kyak. One is paddling
and the other has the rifle across his knees,
and the polar bears are nervously pacing the
ice-pan as though conscious of the fate impending.
Another motif in these diverting
rugs—which are often used for wall adornments
instead of floor-covering—is a stately
procession of three bears uphill past the solemn
green sentinels of pagoda-like fir trees. What
an improvement these designs are over the
former rugs which showed meaningless
blotches of pink and green that might have
been thrown at one another, as if a mason’s
trowel had splashed them there!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since the Labrador is innocent in most
places of anything like a store where you can
go to the counter, lay down your money and
ask for what you want, the nearest thing the
women know to the luxury of a shopping-expedition
or a bargain-sale is a chance to exchange
firewood or fish for the old clothing
carried on her missionary journeys by the
<span class='it'>Strathcona</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why isn’t this clothing given away?”
someone may query unthinkingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The object of the mission is not to pauperize,
and the pride of the people themselves
in most cases forbids the acceptance of an
outright gift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To preserve self-respect by the exchange of
a <span class='it'>quid pro quo</span>, some of the clothing contributed
by friends in the States and elsewhere
is allocated to the fishermen’s families in return
for the supplies of firewood. The value
varies according to the place where the wood
is cut and piled. It may be worth $7 a cord
on a certain point or $3 at the bottom of a
bay. (Cutting the wood is called “cleaving
the splits.”) The payment must be very
carefully apportioned, so that Mrs. B. shall
not have more or better than Mrs. A.—or else
there will be wailing and gnashing and heart-burning
after the boat weighs anchor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before making the rounds of the Straits or
of White Bay, or going on the long trail down
North, or wherever else the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span> may
be faring on her mission, the big boxes of
wearables are opened on the deck and stored in
a pinched triangular stateroom forward of the
saloon. There are quantities of clothing for
men—overcoats, sweaters of priceless wool,
reefers, peajackets, shooting-coats, dressing-gowns,
underwear—some of it brand new and
most of it thick and good; there are woolen
socks excellently made by many loving hands,
shoes joined by the laces or buttoned together,
trousers, jackets, whole suits more or less in
disrepair but capable of conversion to all sorts
of useful ends. Generally the Doctor and
Mrs. Grenfell find a pretext for giving some
of the clothing to a needy family even when
the fiction of payment in kind is not maintained.
Rarely does the article offered—let
us say a hooked rug in garish colours—meet
the value of the garments that are given. But
the important thing is that the recipient is
made to feel that he pays for what he gets
and is not a pauper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is ever a want of clothing for the
women and children. Few complete dresses
for women find their way to the <span class='it'>Strathcona’s</span>
storeroom. There are not nearly enough
garments for babies or suits for little boys.
Women’s underclothing is badly needed. But
most of those who come aboard in quest of
clothing are grateful for whatever is given
them and make no fuss. They will ingeniously
adapt a shirt into a dress for Susy, and
cut a big man’s trousers in twain for her two
small brothers. The Northern housewife
learns to make much of little in the way of
textile materials. A barrel of magazines and
cards and picture scrap-books shielded with
canvas, stands at the head of the companion
way. Bless whoever pasted in the stories and
pictures on the strong sheets of brown cartridge-paper!
Those will be pored over by
lamp-light from cottage to cottage till they
fall apart, just as the wooden boxes of books
carried aboard for circulating libraries will
provide most of the life intellectual all winter
long for many a village. Many of the fishermen’s
families from the father down are
unlettered, but those who can read and write
make up for it by their intellectual activity,
and even the little boys sometimes display a
nimbleness of wit and fancy altogether delightful.
They will sing you a song or tell
you a fairy-tale with a naïveté foreign to the
American small boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A woman came aboard with her husband—pale,
thin, forlorn she was—and asked for
clothing for him. She held each garment
critically to the light, and somewhat disdainfully
rejected any that showed signs of mending.
Finally I said: “You’re not taking
anything for yourself. Don’t you need
something?” I knew the pitiful huddle of
fishermen’s houses ashore from which she
came—the entire population of the settlement
was 141, not counting the vociferous array of
Eskimo dogs that greeted us when we landed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like a dress,” she admitted—“for
street wear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I thought of the straggling path amid the
rocks where the dogs growled and bristled,
but I did not smile. For I realized what this
chance to go shopping meant to her isolated
life. In the city she would have had huge
warerooms and piled counters from which to
make a choice. Here two bunks, a barrel and
a canvas bag held the whole stock in trade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rejected a sleeveless ball gown of
burgundy. “I must have black,” she said—“we
lost a son in the war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The husband began to apologize for the
trouble they caused. But we were more than
ever bound to please them now. All the new
skirts were found to be too short or too long
or too gay or too youthful or something else,
and the upshot of the dickering was that two
pairs of golfer’s breeches were given in lieu
of proper habiliments for a poor, lonely
woman in Labrador. They could be cut down,
she explained, for her boys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There isn’t much for a woman, in most of
these places, but cooking and scrubbing the
floor and minding the baby—something like
the Kaiser’s ideal of feminine existence. And
when the floor is clean, booted fishermen
come in and spit upon it even though the white
plague is plainly written in the children’s
faces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A new chapter in the industrial history of
the Labrador will be written when it becomes
possible to utilize the vast supply of news-print
available from the pulp-wood of the Labrador
“hinterland,” even as Northcliffe is getting
paper for his many publications from the plant
at Grand Falls in Northern Newfoundland.
The difficulty, of course, will be to get the
timber away from the coast in the short season
when the land is released from the grip of the
ice-pack. But the great demand for news-print
which leads to anxious examination and
utilization of the supplies of Alaska and Finland
cannot much longer neglect the available
resources so near at hand on the coast of the
North Atlantic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Humbermouth it was my good fortune
to encounter Captain Daniel Owen, of Annapolis
Royal, Nova Scotia, Captain of the H. V.
Greene Labrador Aerial Expedition. The
little vessel <span class='it'>Miranda</span> had limped in on her way
to Halifax, to get her boiler mended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Owen, himself, deserves more than
passing mention. A member of the Royal
Flying Corps, he had his left eye shot out in
combat with five German planes that brought
him to the ground 60 miles within their lines.
The observer’s leg was shattered in nine places
by their fire. There followed a sojourn of
seven months in three German prison-camps.
The chivalrous surgeon who was first to
operate on Captain Owen’s comrade amused
himself and the nurses by twisting bits of bone
about in the leg, laughing, while the nurses
laughed too, at the patient’s agony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flying at a height of 2,000 to 8,700 feet,
Captain Owen’s party in Labrador added to
the industrial map 1,500,000 acres (about
2,300 square miles) of land timbered with firs
and spruces suitable for pulp-wood, the property
lying on the Alexis, St. Louis and Gilbert
Rivers about 15 miles north of Battle Harbour.
This tract will, it is estimated, produce as
much as 115 cords to the acre for a maximum,
and on the average 40 to 50 cords. 15,000
photographs were taken, and moving pictures
also were made. The aerodrome was 28 miles
up the Alexis River, and according to Captain
Owen it was an extremely serious matter to
find the way back to it each time after a flight
for there was no other suitable place to land
anywhere in the neighbourhood. “I never felt
so anxious for the return of an aeroplane in
the Western Front as I felt for the safety of
ours,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flying took place on five different days—and
in that time as much was accomplished
as might have been done in from six to ten
years of the usual land cruising which—in
sample areas—was used to check up the results
of the airmen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The propeller of the Curtiss biplane was a
mass of blood from the flies it sucked in. Dr.
Murdock Graham, second in command, kept
some of these flies in a bottle as souvenirs, and
they were portentous insects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We enjoyed nothing more,” said Dr.
Graham, “than an evening spent with Dr.
Grenfell at Battle Harbour where, lolling at
ease in corduroy and his old Queen’s College
blazer with the insignia over the left breast-pocket,
pulling a corn-cob pipe, he spun one
yarn after another of the life at the Front
with the Harvard contingent in 1915-16.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Murphy, the mail-man from Battle Harbour,
friend of the Grenfell mission, friend of
everybody, is a man worth knowing. I can
hear now his genial ‘Does ye smoke, boy?
Has ye any on ye? Does ye mind, boy?’ He
said to one of our Greene Expedition doctors,
‘Doctor, are all the Americans like ye? Ye
has a kind word for everybody. Has ye any
tobacco?’ ‘By gorry, that’s fine,’ he said of
the aeroplane. ‘How do it do it?’ He was
as modest as he was plucky. ‘I don’t want to
go and eat with all those gentlemen, with their
fine clothes on,’ he would say. Of one of the
young ‘liveyeres’ he remarked: ‘If he had
the learn there’d be a fine job for him’—which
alas! is true of so many on the Labrador.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No member of our expedition heard any
swearing from the forty men we employed—with
the exception of a single Newfoundlander.
I asked one of the men how they came
to be so clean of profanity, and he answered
simply: ‘We doesn’t make a practice of that,
we doesn’t.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At Williams Harbour on the Alexis River
there was three weeks’ schooling by a visiting
teacher from the Grenfell mission. In two
families with a joint membership of eighteen
one person could read and write.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have had no minister since the war
and in the winter the bottom falls out of everything.
The people on the rivers have no doctor
for a year and a half and two years at a
time. At Williams Harbour they swarmed to
Dr. Twiss and Dr. MacDonald. One woman
in desperation had been treating pneumonia
with salt-water, snow and white moss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dr. Grenfell and his people have more
than they can do. We all of us realize today
as we never understood before the meaning to
the people of the North of the presence of
Grenfell and his people among them. We
caught the spirit of the work inevitably, and
tried to do what good we could while we were
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The folk of the Alexis and the St. Louis
River districts, as a rule, can’t afford the price
of gas to go to Battle Harbour. It’s a day’s
run, and there’s nobody to mind their cod-traps
when they’re away. So one can imagine
how completely they’d be shut out of the world
but for the contacts which the mission provides
even at such long intervals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“William Russell is the grand old man of
Williams Harbour. He is the most-travelled
and the best-educated man of those parts, and
he represents the finest type of patriarch. He
never saw a horse or a cow or an automobile;
he has never been south of Battle Harbour,
though he has visited that diminutive settlement
four times. He was dumfounded at our
aeroplane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In his family the father’s word was law
to the twelve children. They never thought
of questioning his authority. They were the
best behaved and most dutiful children I have
ever seen. Their obedience was absolute, and
their manner to strangers was deferential.
They always said ‘Yes, sir,’ and ‘No, sir,’
most politely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At his house thirty-one gathered to hear
the gramophone—for the first time. They
were packed in as tight as could be, choking
the room with their tobacco-smoke. The first
night they were silent. The next night they
were excited, and on the third they became
hilarious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As I said, following the Grenfell example,
we did what doctoring we could on the side.
The constant diet of bread and tea, tea and
bread is hard on the teeth. There is much
pyorrhea due to this diet, to limestone in the
water, and to failure to clean the teeth. At
Blanc Sablon we treated a little boy who had
suffered for three weeks with the toothache.
It was a simple case of congested pulp. The
relief was immediate. It is a joy and a reward
to behold the gratitude of those who are
helped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you if these people who question the
value of Grenfell’s work, or wonder why he
chooses to spend his life in bleak and barren
places, could just see his ‘parishioners’
and know their gratitude toward their benefactors,
they would understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was a picturesque soul at Blanc
Sablon who asked for tobacco, which we gave
him. He was never off the coast. I don’t
know where he had heard a violin. But to
make some return to us for the smoke, he gave
us an imitation of a man first tuning and then
playing a violin, which was perfect in its way.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span><h1>VI<br/>THE SPORTSMAN</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>As we were coming off to the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span>
one evening, the Doctor, bareheaded,
pulling at the oars with the zest of a
schoolboy on a holiday, and every oar-dip
making a running flame of phosphorescence,
said: “At college we worshipped at the shrine
of athletics. Of course that wasn’t right, but
it did establish a standard—it did teach a man
that he must keep his body under if he would
be physically fit. I realized that if I wanted
to win I couldn’t afford to lose an ounce, and
so I was a rigid Spartan with myself. The
others sometimes laughed at me as a goody-goody,
but they saw that I could do things
that couldn’t be done by those who indulged
in wild flings of dissipation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My schooling before Oxford I now feel
was wretched. They didn’t teach me how to
learn. The teachers themselves were mediocre.
They may have had a smattering of the classics—but
that doesn’t constitute fitness to teach.
Have you read the chapter on education in
H. G. Well’s ‘Joan and Peter’? That strikes
me as true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad my orphan children at St. Anthony
are getting the right kind of training
from those who understand their business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor still cherishes the insignia of
rowing and athletic clubs to which he was
attached while at Oxford. One of his pet coats
wears the initials “O. U. R. F. C.” for the
Oxford University Rugby Football Club. He
also stroked the <span class='it'>Torpid</span> crew, and the crew
of the London Hospital.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hates—in fact, he refuses, like Peter
Pan—to grow up or to grow old. “Isn’t it too
bad that just when our minds have struck their
stride and are doing their best work we should
have to end it all?” Not that he has the least
fear of Death. In the country of his loving
labour, the fisher-folk face Death so often in
their lawful occasions, for the sake of you and
me who enjoy the savour of the codfish and the
lobster, that when Death finally comes he
comes not as a dark and awful figure but as
a familiar and a friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conflict of elemental forces in nature
finds at once an echo in the breast of him who
has met “with a frolic heart” every mood and
tense of sky and sea “down north.” At
Pleasure Harbour the sunset amid dark purple
clouds edged with a rosy fleece brought “vital
feelings of delight”: and when we came
nearest the Dominion’s northern tip the Doctor
said: “I wish you could see the strait ice and
the Atlantic ice fight at Cape Bauld. They go
at each other hammer and tongs, with a roaring
and rending like huge wild animals,
rampant and foaming and clashing their
tusks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On a foggy, super-saturated day, the sails
and the deck beaded and dripping, he will
fairly rub his hands in ecstasy and exclaim:
“Oh, what a fine day!” Or he will thrust his
ruddy countenance out of his chart-room door
to call: “Isn’t it great to be alive?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Off Cape Norman, when the foghorn was
blaspheming and the sea ran high, I tried to get
the Doctor to concede that it was half a gale,
but he would only admit that it was a “nice
breeze.” The new topsail stubbornly declined
to blossom out as it should, though the five
other sails were in full bloom. “We’ll burst
it out,” said the Doctor. The offending sail
was forthwith hauled down and stretched like
a sick man on the deck; then it was tied in
three places with tarry cords, the Doctor
scurried up the mast, the sail was raised into
place by means of the clanking winch, and
then, with violent tugs of the fierce wind like
a fish plucking at a tempting bait the three
confining strings snapped in explosive succession
and like a flag unfurling the sail sprang
out to the breeze. We raised a cheer as
the perceptible lift of the additional sail-cloth
thrilled the timbers underfoot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You’d hear him trotting about the deck in
the cool dawn inquiring about steam or tide
and humming softly (or lifting with the
fervour of a sailor’s chantey), that favourite
Newfoundland hymn, written by a Newfoundlander,
“We love the place, O God, wherein
thine honour dwells.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the wheelhouse as he looks out over the
sea and guides the prow, as if it were a sculptor’s
chisel, through calm or storm, there comes
into his eyes a look as of communing with a
far country: his soul has gone to a secret,
distant coast where no man and but one
woman can follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes of an evening the Doctor brought
out the chessboard and I saw another phase
of his versatile entity—his fondness for an indoor
game that is of science and not blind
chance. The red and white ivory chessmen,
in deference to the staggering ship, had sea-legs
in the shape of pegs attaching them to the
board. Two missing pawns—“prawns,” the
Doctor humorously styled them—had as substitutes
bits of a red birthday candle, and two
of the rooks were made of green modelling-wax
(plasticine).</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love to attack,” said the Doctor, and his
tactics proved that he meant what he said. He
has what Lord Northcliffe once named to me
as the capital secret of success—concentration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he has once moved a piece forward he
almost never moves it back again. He likes
to go ahead. He seeks to get his pieces out and
into action, and a defensive, waiting game—the
strategy of Fabius the Cunctator—is not
for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once in a while he defers sufficiently to the
conventions to move out the King’s pawn at
the start, but often his initial move is that of
a pawn at the side of the board. He works
the pawns hard and gives them a new significance.
His delight is to march a little platoon
of them against the enemy—preferably against
the bishops. Somehow the bishops seem to
lose their heads when confronted by these
minor adversaries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If you get him into a tight corner, the opposition
stiffens—the greater the odds the more
vertebral his attitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I make it a rule to go ahead if I possibly
can, and not to be driven back.” This remark
of his over the board of the mimic fray applies
just as well to his constant strife with the sea
to get where he is wanted—as on the present
occasion when we were threading the needle’s
eye of the rocky outlet at Carpoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor has the real chess mind—the
mind that surveys and weighs and analyzes—with
the uncanny faculty of looking many
moves ahead, of balancing all the alternatives,
of remembering the disposal of the forces at
a previous stage of the game. He becomes
so completely immersed in the playing—though
he rarely finds an antagonist—that it
is a real rest to him after the teeming day,
where many a man would only find it a culminant
exhaustion. “Isn’t it queer,” he observed,
“that most men who are good at this
game aren’t good for much else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His use of the pawns in chess is like his use
of the weaker reeds among men in his day’s
work. Since he cannot always get the best
(though his hand-picked helpers at St. Anthony,
Battle Harbour and elsewhere are as a
rule exceptionally able), he learns to use the
inferior and the lesser, and with exemplary
gentleness and patience he keeps his temper and
lets them think they are assisting though they
may be all but hindering. He gives you to
feel that if you hold a basin or sharpen a knife
or fetch a bottle or bring him a chair you are
of real value in the performance of an operation—even
if the basin was upset and the knife
was dull and the bottle wasn’t the one and the
chair had a broken leg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Christ used ordinary men,” he remarked.
“He was a carpenter, and I try to teach people
that he was a good sportsman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All through his chess games, too, runs the
Oxford principle of sport for its own sake:
he wins, but the strife is more than the victory.
He is never vainglorious when the checkmate
comes; he is neither unduly elated by success
nor depressed by adversity—indeed, his enjoyment
is keenest when he is beset. He shows
then the same strain that comes out when the
ship is anchored and Mate Albert Ash pokes
his head in and says: “If she drags, we’ve got
but one chain out!” Then he will say nothing,
or with a humorous twinkle he will cry in
mock despair: “All is lost!” or “if you knew
how little water there was under her you would
be scared!”—and then he will go on with
what he is doing. Whether it is the chessboard
or life’s battlefield, he plays the game.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the end of a hackmatack (juniper) log
lying on the deck for firewood I pencilled for
fun: “The Log of the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span>.” The
Doctor saw it, laughed, and got a buck-saw.
Two fishermen clambered over the rail between
him and the woodpile, to get zinc ointment
and advice. When he had “fixed them
up” he sawed off the log-end, and drew a picture
of the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span>—an entirely correct
picture, of course, as far as it went—and then
put his signature (à la Whistler butterfly) in
the form of a roly-poly elf, as rotund as a
dollar. “I like to draw myself stout and
round,” he laughed. The strange gnome he
drew was the very antithesis of his own lithe,
spare, close-knit figure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So good a playmate and so firm a master—so
rare a combination of gentleness and
strength, of self-respect and rollicking fun is
difficult to match in real life or in biographic
literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Were one to seek a historic parallel for
Grenfell one might not go far wrong in picking
Xenophon. Xenophon was a leader who
pointed the way not from the rear but from
the head of the column, and asked of his men
nothing that he would not do himself. The
reader of the “Anabasis” will remember that
Xenophon awoke in the night and asked himself
“Why do I lie here? For the night goes
forward. And with the morn it is probable
that the enemy will come.” Even so, Grenfell
feels that he must do the works of the Master
while it is yet day, for all too soon the night
cometh when no man can work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Xenophon had sedition on his hands, and
his men would not go out into the snows of
the mountains of Armenia and cut the wood.
So he left his tent and seized an ax and hewed
so valorously that they were shamed into
following suit. That is just what Wilfred
Grenfell would have done: it is what his forbear
Sir Richard Grenville would have done.
In such ways as this when the hour strikes
the born leader of men asserts himself and
takes command.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span><h1>VII<br/>THE MAN OF SCIENCE</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor admires certain of his
scientific colleagues greatly: he is
candidly a hero-worshipper. “I love
Cushing and Finney,” he says outspokenly of
the noted Harvard and Johns Hopkins surgeons.
A clinic by Dr. George de Schweinitz
or an operation by Dr. John B. Deaver is a
rare treat to him. Sir Frederick Treves, the
great English surgeon, has been among his
closest friends since Grenfell served under him
in a London hospital: he has leaned on him
always for perceptive advice and sympathy unfailing.
It is one of the paramount satisfactions
of his life to meet other minds in his
profession that stimulate his own. In the
ceaseless round of his activities little time is
left him to read books: but if he could he
would enjoy no pastime more than to browse
in a well-chosen library. The victories of
science hold for him the fascination of
romance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The discovery of the electron, in his opinion,
might make it possible to have an entire city
in which every material substance should be
invisible. “There is no reason why the forces
in action should make a visible city. We believe
today in the unity of matter. It has
almost been demonstrated that we can turn
soda into copper. Uranium passes into
radium. Carrel is growing living protoplasm
outside the body. Adami has shown how an
electric stimulus applied to the ovum of frogs
produces twins. The electron is the manifestation
of force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is almost certain that there is no such
thing as physical life. No matter could exist
without movement—the sort of movement you
behold when the spinthariscope throws the
radiations from bromide of radium on a
fluorescent screen. If there is no physical life,
there is no death. So many things exist that
we do not see. We cannot see ether or weigh
it, but we know that it exists. There is a
physical explanation of the resurrection. The
whole universe is incessant motion, just as
sound is vibration—the ordinary C with 256
vibrations, the octave with 512, the next octave
with 1,024 vibrations to the second.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tin is a mass of whirling electrons. Gold
is composed of a different number of electrons.
That’s why we can’t cross from one to the
other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not quite fair to put down these random
remarks, on an extremely abstruse matter—thrown
over the Doctor’s shoulder as he flits
about a village, the dogs at his heels—without
quoting his more deliberate formulation of his
ideas in an article in “Toilers of the Deep.”
In that article he writes:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If chemistry of today has made it certain
that there is no such thing in the human body
as a transcendental entity called ‘life,’ and
every function and every organ of the body
can be chemically or physically accounted for,
then it is obvious that we have no reason to
weep for it. More infinitely marvellous the
more we learn of it, so marvellous that no one
can begin to appreciate it but the man of
science, it helps us to realize how easily He
who clothed us with it can provide another
equally well adapted to the needs of that which
awaits us when we go ‘home.’ We have
learned to enlarge our physical capacities, our
‘selves,’ the microscope, the ultramicroscope,
the spectroscope, the electroscope, the spinthariscope,
the ophthalmoscope, the fluoroscope,
the telescope, and other man-made machines
have made the natural range of the
eye of man a mere bagatelle compared with
what it now commands and reveals. The
microphone, the megaphone, the audophone,
the wireless and other machinery have as
greatly enlarged our command of the field of
sound. Space has been largely conquered by
electric devices for telephoning, telegraphing,
and motor power. On the land, under the
sea, in the air, man is rapidly acquiring a
mastery that is miraculous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The marvels of manufacture are miracles.
Machinery can now do anything, even talk
and sing far beyond the powers of normal human
capacities. The plants and animals of
normal nature can be improved beyond
recognition. The old deserts are being forced
to blossom like roses; the most potent governing
agencies of the life of the body, like
adrenalin, can be made from coal tar. Seas
are linked by broad water pathways, countries
are united by passages through mountains and
under the water. We can see through solid
bodies, we can weigh the stars in balances, we
can tell their composition without seeing
them. We can describe the nature and place
of unseen heavenly bodies, and know the existence
and properties of elements never seen
or heard of. We know that movement is not
a characteristic of life, unless we are to believe
that the very rocks are alive, for we can see
that it is movement alone that holds their
ultimate atoms together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The mere ‘Me,’ the resultant of all past
and present influences on the ‘I,’ is so marvellous,
that we must find it ever increasingly
impossible to conceive that we are the products
of blind chance, or the sport of a cruelty so
horrible as to make the end one inconceivable
tragedy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, if science teaches that there is no
entity called ‘life,’ and it seems to do so, I
for my part gladly accept it as yet another
tribute at the feet of the Master Builder who
made and gave my spirit—mine, if you please—a
spirit so insignificant, so unworthy, such
an unspeakable gift as that of a body with
capacities such as this one, to be the mechanical
temple and temporary garment of my spirit,
and to offer me a chance to do my share to
help this wonderful world. ‘No life,’ says
science, ‘there is no life.’ But a knowledge
more reliable than current knowledge, that
entered the world with the advent of man, and
that has everywhere in every race of mankind
been in the past his actually most valued
possession, replies ‘Yes, and there is no death
either.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day his morning greeting was:
“Nitrogen is gone!” “Too bad!” I said.
“You can search me. I haven’t got it.” “I
mean,” he explained, “that here in this copy
of the ‘Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society
of Canada’ Sir Ernest Rutherford sets
forth the theory that the molecule of nitrogen
is a helium universe with hydrogen for its
satellites and helium as the sun.” He was almost
as much interested in the discovery as if it
were a hole in the bottom of his boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve just been reading a magazine article on
the subject of psychic research by Booth Tarkington,”
he added presently. “It’s well written
and exceedingly interesting. Most men of
science have been convinced of the reality of the
spiritual body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He is an artist of no slight attainment and in
his home at St. Anthony specimens of his
handicraft abound, but not obtrusively. Dr.
Grenfell never puts anything that he is or has
done on view to be admired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He is a keen ornithologist, and even when
he is at top speed to get back to his boat and
weigh anchor he will pause to note the friendly
grackles hopping about a wharf or the unfettered
grace of the gyrations of the creaking
gulls. He is a collector of butterflies. “I
was out driving with a man who didn’t see
the butterflies and had no interest in them.
Just think what such a man misses in his life!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He also collects birds’ eggs, flowering plants
(many of which have been named at Cambridge),
seaweed and shells. The great book
he wrote and edited on Labrador gives a clear
idea of his interest in the geology as well as
the fauna and flora of the region.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I found him the last thing at night at St.
Anthony trying to discover why one of a pair
of box kites he had made wouldn’t remain
aloft as it should.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He is perpetually acquisitive and inquisitive:
the diversity of his interests rivals the appetite
of Roosevelt for every sort of information.
Sir Frederick Treves mourned that a great
surgeon was lost to London when Grenfell
embarked on the North Sea to the healing and
helping of fishermen. But Grenfell has become
much more than a great surgeon. With
all that he is and does, he gives to every part
of his almost boundless field of interests a
careful, methodical, analytic intellect. Haste
and the constant pressure of his over-driven
life have not made him superficial. He sets a
sail with the same care he gives to the setting
of a compound fracture: he is of the number
of those who believe that there is but one right
way to do everything. Of such is the kingdom
of science and of inestimable service.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span><h1>VIII<br/>THE MAN OF LAW</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>In his capacity as magistrate, the Doctor
never sidesteps trouble. Law in his part
of the world is a matter not merely of the
letter but of the spirit—not of the statute
alone but of shrewd common sense. His decisions
are luminous with a Lincolnian light
of acumen and sympathy at once. He lets the
jot and tittle—the mint, anise-seed and cummin—take
care of themselves, and considers the
real significance of the situation and the
essential nature of the offence. Red tape is
not the important thing, and the imaginary
dignity of an invisible judicial ermine is not
besmirched because Magistrate Grenfell discusses
the case with a culprit as a father might
talk things over with a son, and makes it plain
why wrong was done—if it was done—and
why there must henceforth be a different
course on the part of the offender. He “lays
down the law” not as if it were a Mosaic
dispensation from a beclouded mountain top,
but as if it were the simple and discreet way
to walk for God-fearing and reasonable mankind.
To him, forever, a man’s own soul is
a matter more important than an ordinance,
and he spares no pains to make his meaning so
plain that the dullest apprehension cannot fail
to grasp it. You will see Grenfell at his best
when—in a whipping wind, bareheaded,
sweatered, rubber-booted—he stands in the
clear glitter of a bracing sunny day on the
beach with the dogs aprowl around him, painstakingly
explaining to a fisherman why it is
right to do thus and reprehensible to do otherwise.
And now and then a hearty laugh or
a timely anecdote—Lincoln’s trait again—clears
the atmosphere. Sometimes there are
more formidable leets and law courts held
among the whalemeat barrels and the firewood
on the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span>: but more often it is a plain
matter of a tête-à-tête while Grenfell is on his
rambling rounds of a hamlet with his dilapidated
leather bag of instruments and medicines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Forteau offered its own problems to Dr.
Grenfell, the Magistrate. There is an isle not
far away where that sometimes toothsome bird
the puffin makes his home. Fishermen from
Forteau, hard put to it to secure anti-scorbutic
fresh meat, might now and then shoot one of
the birds, and the duty of the faithful lighthouse-keeper,
Captain Coté, an appointed
game-warden, was to see that the law’s majesty
made itself respected. One day Coté caught
a hunter red-handed. “By what warrant do
you arrest me?” said the man behind the gun.
“By this!” said Coté, flourishing a revolver.
Is a magistrate to blame if he believes that
common sense should differentiate between a
poor fisherman desperate with hunger, and a
pot-hunter who commits wholesale murder
among the eider-ducks sitting on their nests?
Usually it is the poor fisherman who is fined
and made to give up his gun, because he
pleads “guilty,” while the pot-hunter who unblushingly
pleads “not guilty” goes scot-free.
A fisherman at Flower’s Cove told me that
a late lamented coast magistrate—who got half
of the fines he imposed—was making “big
money” from his calling. He fined one man
$100 for importing a second-hand stove without
paying customs duties. When the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span>
hove in sight, bearing Dr. Grenfell, this
profiteering magistrate weighed anchor in
haste, and in a heavy beam sea and shallow
water made his “get-away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are always disputes between traders
and fishermen to be adjudicated. Two men
within an hour of each other clambered over
the rail of the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span> to display dire
written threats of wrath to come from the
same West Coast merchant, in a court summons
served by a constable. This document,
accompanying a bill of particulars, says that
if they don’t pay at once the balance due
they’ll have to go to St. John’s at a cost of
fifty dollars in addition to whatever the
amount may be which the law assesses against
them. It isn’t just the amount of the ticket
to St. John’s, or the board while they are
there: it’s the loss of time from the traps that
is exacerbating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trader isn’t in the wrong just because
he is a trader. The fisherman hasn’t all the
right on his side by the fact of being a fisherman,
but the bookkeeping of these traders
seemed to be at very loose ends indeed. Long
after the debtor thought he had paid all his
debt, in cash or in kind, the trader unearthed
on the books items of 1915, 1916 or 1917
which he forgot to charge for. Here they bob
up like a bay seal, to the consternation of the
man who thought the slate had been sponged
off clean “far away and long ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the two who brought their present
perplexity to the Doctor had had the misfortune
to lose his house by fire, and all the
trader’s receipts therein, so that he had no
written line to show against the trader’s bill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I found out later that the trader’s daughters
kept the books—in fact, I saw them behind the
counter at their father’s store—and they were
said to be indifferent and slovenly misses indeed,
who used their thumbs for erasures and
made as many mistakes in a day’s work as
there are blueberries on Blomidon. Perhaps
they were in love—but their hit-or-miss accountancy
meant a terrible worriment for sea-faring
men two hundred miles distant, and a
pother of trouble for Dr. Grenfell and a St.
John’s lawyer—a friend of the Doctor’s who
befriends those who cannot afford or do not
know how to obtain legal advice.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span><h1>IX<br/>THE MAN OF GOD</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>In his formal addresses Dr. Grenfell exemplifies
the homely, pithy eloquence that
comes from speaking directly “to men’s
business and bosoms” out of the fulness of
the heart: but those who have heard him in
the little, informal, offhand talks he gives
among his own people in his own bailiwick
appreciate them even more than what he has
to say to a congregation of strangers in a
great city far from the Labrador.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must be understood that the quotations
that follow are merely extemporaneous, unrevised
sentences taken down without the Doctor’s
knowledge, and of a nature wholly casual
and unpremeditated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a service held in the tiny saloon of the
<span class='it'>Strathcona</span> for the crew and the patients who
happened to be with us, the Doctor said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We so often think that religion is bound
to be dull and solemn and monotonous: we
don’t follow the example of Christ who spread
light and joy wherever he went. None of us
is perfect, but God doesn’t denounce Dr. Grenfell
and Will Sims and Albert Ash (naming
members of the crew) for their shortcomings.
That isn’t his way. He knows us as we are,
with all our weaknesses. He loved David—he
said that David was a man after his own
heart. Yet David was a bad man—he was an
adulterer and incidentally a murderer, and he
got his people into trouble that lost thousands
of their lives. But God loved him in spite
of his human frailties, because he did such a
lot of good in the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t do to take a single text. For
instance—we read ‘The world is established
so that it cannot be moved,’ but we know that
it is all movement: we know that it moves at
a pace six times as fast as the fastest aeroplane.
But the Church looked at that verse
and said that he who denied it was denying
the truth. I was reading this morning about
Copernicus, who insisted that this world is
round. Up to his time men had insisted that
it was flat and that you might fall off the
edge. Then there was Galileo, who said that
it moved: and they put him under the thumbscrews,
and when he came out he said, ‘and
still it does move.’</p>

<p class='caption'>DR. GRENFELL LEADING MEETING AT BATTLE HARBOUR.</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“So often Christian people think it’s their
duty to forbid and to repress and to bring
gloom with a long face where they go. But
that wasn’t Christ’s way and it isn’t God’s
way. If religious people do these things people
begin to suppose that religion is something
to destroy the joy of living. But that isn’t
what it’s for. It’s to make us kinder to
fathers and mothers and sisters and friends,
and true to the duty nearest our hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love to think of David as the master
musician who went about scattering good and
dispelling the clouds of heaviness. We ought
to follow his example. Sometimes we say
‘Oh, they’ve all been so mean to me I’ll take
it out on them by being sour and dull and
jealous and bitter!’ Here in this crew we
get to know one another almost as well as
God knows us, and we see one another’s
faults. It’s so easy to spy out faults when
we’re so close together, day after day. But
we should be blind to some things—like Nelson
at Copenhagen. You remember when
they gave the signal to retreat he put his blind
eye to the telescope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If God looked for the faults in us, who
could stand before Him? None of us is perfect.
Let us judge not that we be not judged,
and mercifully learn to make allowances. I
knew a man who had been the cause of a
loss of $20,000 to his employer, through
costly litigation that was the result of his
mistakes. His master, nevertheless, gave him
a second chance, with an even better job.
Later I asked him if the man was making
good. He replied, ‘He is the best servant I
have.’ Even so we ought to learn to be long-suffering
with others, as God is lenient until
seventy times seven with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the little church at Flower’s Cove the
Doctor spoke on the meaning of the words of
Christ in Mark 8, 34, as given in the vernacular
version: “If any man wishes to walk in
my steps, let him renounce self, take up his
cross, and follow me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is there that a man values more
than his life?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I was here early in the spring there
was a man who was in a serious way. I told
him he should come to the hospital at St. Anthony
for an operation. He said he must get
his traps and his twine ready. Then when I
came again in June I saw that he was worse,
and I again gave him warning that in six
months at most the results might be fatal.
Still he said that he could not go. When I
came ashore today I learned that he was dead.
The twine was ready—but he was gone. That
is the way with so many of us. We say we
are too busy—we can always give that excuse—and
then death finds us, grasping our
material possessions, perhaps, but with the
great ends of life unwon. Its only a stage that
we cross for a brief transit, coming in at this
door and going out at that. It won’t do to
play our part just as we are making our
exit—we must play it while we are in the
middle of the stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At Sandwich Bay we followed a stream and
the two men on the other side called my attention
to the tracks of a bear: and when we
came back to the boat the men aboard said
they had seen two bears wandering about. The
bears were unable to hide their tracks, and even
so you and I cannot conceal the traces of
our footsteps where we went. Captain Coté
at the Greenly Island Light showed us the
model of a steamship—made with a motor
costing a dollar and a half that ran it in a
straight line for an hour. It had no volition
of its own. Man is not like that soulless
boat: he has a mind of his own. We are
surrounded by amazing discoveries: great
scientists are ever toiling on the problem of
communication with the dead. Men laughed
at the alchemists of old: we laugh no longer
at the idea of changing one substance into
another. We can change water with electricity
and change one frog’s egg into twins. We
can fly from St. John’s to England in a day.
We can see through solid substances—come to
St Anthony and I will show it to you with
the X-ray apparatus. What fools we are to
deny immortality and the resurrection! What
are realized values as compared with the
spiritual? There was the ship <span class='it'>Royal Charter</span>
for Australia that went ashore at Moidra in
Wales. A sailor wrapped himself in gold and
it drowned him. Would you say that he had
the gold or that the gold had him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The carol of good King Wenceslaus tells
us of the blessings that came to the little lad
who followed in the footsteps of the king.
Even so, better things than any temporal benefits
come to us if we walk in the steps of
Christ.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of the soldiers of the war returning
to this country are not acting as soldiers
should. They are importing foreign vices. I
have seen lately horrible examples of the suffering
of the innocents as a result of their misdeeds.
There are more communicable diseases
in the present year than we have ever had before
on this coast. A man has no right to the
title of a soldier who does not walk in Christ’s
steps—he has no right to the name, when he
pleases self and damns his country and his
fellow-men and fellow-women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have among us the deplorable spectacle
of many weak sectarian schools—and it is
a wicked thing that we do not combine them
in strong undenominational ones. So many
things cry out for changing. Today I visited
a family and found the father had tuberculosis.
The mother?—tuberculosis. The children?—tuberculosis.
Then I saw a baby
whose head was not filled up, whose arms were
puny, whose shoulders were constricted.
From what? From rickets. The rickets came
from bad feeding due to ignorance. I saw
another child with the same complaint from
the same cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“American bank-notes are made of paper
that comes from Dalton, Massachusetts. The
finest quality of paper is made of rags. They
can use old rags and dirty rags—but they cannot
use red ones. In explaining the manufacture
to children I heard the manager speak
of the rags as being ‘willing’ or ‘unwilling.’
The red ones were the ‘unwilling’ ones, and
one of the children afterward said she’d rather
be a willing rag. We may be poor and sorry
objects—we may be rags—but there is something
to be made of us if only we are willing
rags.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came to a paralyzed boy. He said,
‘What can I do, Dr. Grenfell?’ I said, ‘You
can smile upon all those who minister to you
or come where you are. You can spread the
spirit of good cheer even from your bedside.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was present at Pilley’s Island when a
soldier came home who had won the V. C.
What a welcome he received! There was a
triumphal arch and the town turned out to do
honour to its hero. He was the right sort of
soldier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norman Duncan wrote a delightful book
called “Doctor Luke of the Labrador” which
very faithfully mirrors the atmosphere of Dr.
Grenfell’s days and doings. But the book is
not to be taken as faithful biography <span class='it'>verbatim
et literatim</span>, in the passages relating to the
titular hero.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor has nothing in the open book
of his past life for which he needs to make
amends; but the hero of “Doctor Luke” has
something mysterious to live down, the precise
nature of which is not divulged. In many admirable
qualities the portrait of “Doctor
Luke” is a faithful likeness of Dr. Grenfell,
and that is why there is a danger that
the reader will think that in all particulars the
book man and the real man correspond. “Doctor
Luke” goes to the Labrador to flee from
his own shadow—a man pursued by bitter
memories of what he has done, and by mocking
wraiths of sin, their fingers pointed at
him. Dr. Grenfell went to the Labrador because
the spirit moved him to go to the help
of men whose lives were as cold as the ice
and as hard as the rock that hemmed them in.
He went not as one who sorrows over
misspent years but as one who rejoices in the
belief that his work has the smile of God
upon it. Dr. Grenfell has the spirit of any
first-rate missionary—he will not admit that
he has elected a life of brain-fag, bodily travail
and spiritual torment. His joy in doing
and giving is unaffected. When he invites
the rest of us to find life beautiful and bountiful
he does not pose nor prate. He walks in
the steps and in the name of Christ with a
child’s humility, a man’s strength, an almost
feminine tenderness and never a breath of that
maudlin, unctuous sanctimoniousness which
always must repel the virile and vertebrate
fibre of the Thomas Hughes brand of “muscular
Christianity.” Dr. Grenfell likes gospel
hymns where some prefer sonatas and concertos,
but he likes them when they carry a
plain and pointed message from the heart to
the heart, and build up a consciousness of our
human interdependence: he would not care
for them if they merely blew into flame the
emotional fire-in-straw that burns itself out
uselessly because of the want of substantial
fuel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the humble millionaire or the haughty
workingman his manner is the same. He
knows what it means “to walk with kings nor
lose the common touch.” Nor is he easily
fooled. “Though I give my body to be
burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me
nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I talked with Mr. A.,” he told me, referring
to his visit with a Croesus of New
York who to certain ends has given largely,
“and I felt somehow that, with all his giving,
he had not given himself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is the secret, it seems to me, of Dr.
Grenfell’s own cogent power upon other
lives—that he goes and does in his own energetic
person. He does not stand at a distance
issuing commands. He is entirely willing to
help anybody, anywhere. He holds back
nothing that he can bestow, and he never
despairs. His ruddy optimism is a matter of
actual daily practice and not of a cloistered
philosophy. You never could persuade him
that with all the heavy burden that he bears,
the myriad interruptions and vexations that
occur, he is not having a grand good time. He
would be entirely ready to say with Stevenson:</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span><h1>X<br/>SOME OF HIS HELPERS</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to write a whole book
about his helpers. He is not a man who
seeks to shine by surrounding himself
with mediocrities. He would be ready to say
with Charles M. Schwab: “I want you to
work not for me but with me.” His presence
is quickening and engenders loyalty. It is fun
to be wherever Dr. Grenfell is because something
is always going on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His helpers never are given to feel that they
are ciphers while he is the integer. Some of
the ablest surgeons of America and of Europe
have ministered to the patients at Battle Harbour,
Indian Harbour and St. Anthony and
on the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span>. There is an utter absence
of “side” and “swank” in this the good
physician, and he never decks himself out in
the borrowed plumage of another’s virtue.
He delights to see a thing well done, and is
the first to bestow the word of earned praise
on the doer. Conversely, he is not happy if a
job is put through in a bungling, half-hearted,
messy fashion; but he keeps his breath to cool
his porridge, and never wastes it by mere
“blowing off” when the mischief is done and
palaver will not mend matters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Human beings are not angels, and even
those who are upheld by a sense of righteous
endeavour may get tired and short-tempered
and disheartened and lonely. Those who attach
themselves to this enterprise for the weeks
of summer sunlight only do not have much
time to develop nostalgia. But “there ain’t
no busses runnin’ from the bank to Mandalay,”
and the Labrador has no theatres, no
picnics, no ball games and few dances. Think
of the large-hearted Moravian Brethren of
the Labrador whose missions are linked with
London by one visit a year from their mission
ship the <span class='it'>Harmony</span>. Think of the man (Mr.
Stewart) who sticks it out by himself at
Ungava round the chill promontory of Cape
Chidley in Ungava Bay. Think of the agents
of the Hudson Bay and other companies dealing
with the “silent, smoky Indian” in the
vast reaches of the North. Whoever essays to
serve God and man in this country must haul
his own weight and bear others’ burdens too.
He must lay aside hindrances—he must forfeit
love of home and kindred—he must learn
to keep normal and cheerful in the aching
solitudes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many are with the Doctor for a season or
so. Some like Dr. Little, Dr. Paddon and Dr.
Andrews and certain others who deserve to
be named <span class='it'>honoris causa</span>—have stood by him
year after year. But by this time there is a
small army of short-term or long-term Grenfell
graduates—men and women—who had
“their souls in the work of their hands” and
whose precious memories are of the days they
spent in assuaging the torment, physical or
spiritual, of plain fisher-folk. It is not possible
to separate in this case the care of bodies
from the cure of souls. The “wops” who
brought the schooner <span class='it'>George B. Cluett</span> from
Boston year after year, laden with lumber and
supplies, and then went ashore to be plumbers
and carpenters and jacks-of-all-trades for love
and not for hire have their own stories to
tell of “simple service simply given to their
own kind in their human need.” Most of
them knew just what they would be up against;
they knew it would not be a glorified house-party;
but they accepted the isolation and the
crudeness and the cold and the unremitting
toil, and in the spirit of good sportsmanship
which is the ruling spirit of the Grenfell undertaking
they played the game, and what they
did is graven deep in the Doctor’s grateful
memory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor wins and keeps the enthusiastic
loyalty of his colleagues because he is so ready
with the word of emphatic praise for what
they do when it is the right thing to do. He
is fearless to condemn, but he would rather
commend, and the flush of pleasure in the
face of the one praised tells how much his
approval has meant to the recipient. He
knows how many persons in this human,
fallible world of ours travel faster for a pat
than for a kick or a blow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A halt was called at Forteau for a few
hours’ conference with one of the remarkable
women who have put their shoulders under
the load of the Labrador—Sister Bailey, once
a co-worker with Edith Cavell. At Forteau
she has a house that holds an immaculate
hospital-ward and an up-to-date dispensary.
For twelve years—except for two visits in
England—she has held the fort here without
the company of her peers, except at long intervals.
She has kept herself surrounded with
books and flowers, and her geraniums are exquisite.
Sister Bailey’s cow, bought for $40
in a bargain at Bonne Esperance (“Bony,”)
is a wonder, and I took pains to stroke the
nose of this “friendly cow” and praise her
life-giving endeavours. For each day at the
crack of dawn there is a line-up of people with
all sorts of containers to get the milk. The
dogs, of course, would cheerfully kill the
animal if they could pull her down, but she
fights them off with her horns, and they have
learned a wholesome fear. She is not like the
cow at Bonne Esperance today, which has suffered
the loss of part of its hind quarters because
it was too gentle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under Sister Bailey’s roof three maids, aged
12, 13 and 22, are being educated in household
management. She has a garden with the dogs
fenced out, and there is a skirmish with the
weeds all through the summer into which winter
breaks so suddenly. There is no spring;
there is no fall; flowers, vegetables and weeds
appear almost explosively together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Artificial flowers are beautifully made—with
dyes from Paris—by the girls of Forteau
Cove, under Sister Bailey’s supervision. The
hues are remarkably close to the original and
the imitation of petal and leaf is so close as
to be startling.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>No description of Dr. Grenfell’s “parish,”
as Norman Duncan aptly styled it, could be
complete without mention—that would be
much more extended did she permit—of the
part Mrs. Grenfell fills in all that the Doctor
does. Mrs. Grenfell was Miss Anna MacClanahan,
of Chicago, and she is a graduate
of Bryn Mawr. The Doctor went to the
Labrador years before his marriage, but since
she took her place at his side with her tact, her
humour, her common sense, her sound judgment
and her broad sympathies, she has been
a tower of strength, a well-spring of solace
and of healing, and altogether an indispensable
factor in her husband’s enterprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She is his secretary, and the number of letters
to be written, of patients’ records to be
kept, of manuscripts to be prepared for the
press is enormous. The Doctor pencils a
memorandum when and where he can—perhaps
sitting atop of a woodpile on the reeling
deck of the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span>; and then Mrs. Grenfell
tames the rebellious punctuation or supplies
the missing links of predicates or prepositions
and evolves a manuscript that need not
fear to face the printer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The letters of appeal are almost innumerable,
of protest occasional, of sympathy and
friendship—with or without subscriptions—very
numerous, and Mrs. Grenfell has the
happy gift of saying “thank you” in such
warm and gracious, individualizing terms that
the donor is enlisted in a lifelong friendship
for the Grenfell idea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Grenfell is “the life of the party”
wherever she goes. Like the Doctor, she refuses
to grow tired of the great game of living,
and it is a game they play together in a
completely understanding and sympathetic
copartnership.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General “Chinese” Gordon once gave as
the reason for not marrying the fact that he
had never found the woman who would follow
him anywhere. Dr. Grenfell has been
more fortunate. A friend of theirs tells me
that Dr. Grenfell proposed on shipboard, almost
the minute he met his wife. Astounded
by his precipitancy, she said: “But, Doctor,
you don’t even know my name!” “That
doesn’t make any difference; I know what it’s
going to be,” is said to have been his characteristic
answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Grenfell was translated from a life
that might have been one of ease and pleasure
and social preoccupation into a life of unremitting
toil and no small measure of actual
hardship, and she meets the day and whatever
it brings in the same high-hearted mood that
her husband carries to the various phases of
his crowded existence. She is his mentor—without
being a tormentor; she is his business
memory and a deal of his common sense and
social conscience: but she never lets her fine,
keen mind, her quick wit and her readily divining
intuition become absorbed in the mechanic
phases of the regulation of household
or boatload business. She has the happy
faculty of instant transplantation from the
practical task to the ideal atmosphere. She
is the Doctor’s workmate, playmate and helpmate:
the complete and inspiring counterpart.
She knows better than anybody else that she
has a great man for a husband, but she never
lets that consciousness become oppressive, and
she knows that it is good for them both to
yield to the playful spirit of rollicking nonsense
and absurd horseplay now and then. So
you needn’t be surprised if you should find the
pair chasing each other about the deck pretending
a mortal combat with billets of birch-wood,
while the distracted Fritz the dog cannot
make up his mind whether he is in duty
bound to bite his mistress or his master. You
needn’t be surprised if the Doctor goes through
a mighty pantomime of barricading his chart-room
as though his better half had no business
in it, or hides some one of her cherished Lares
and Penates and assumes an innocent ignorance
of its whereabouts. When he is at play Dr.
Grenfell is not a bit older than the youngest
of his three delightful children whose combined
ages cannot be much more than fifteen
years. He is the same sort of amusing and
devoted father as the mourned and beloved
head of the household at Sagamore Hill, who
to Dr. Grenfell—of course—is the pattern of
all that the head of a family and the soul of
a nation should be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The family life of the Grenfells and the
perfect mutuality of thought and feeling between
Dr. Grenfell and his wife stand out in
clear-cut lines as an example to those who
never have known the meaning of the complete
community of ideals in the family life
and in the relationship of wife and husband.
It stands in rebuke to the sorrowful travesty
the modern marriage so often exhibits. It
shows how the strength of either partner in the
marriage of true minds is multiplied tenfold
and how the yoke is easy and the burden is
light when love has entered in⁠—</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span><h1>XI<br/>FOUR-FOOTED AIDES: DOGS AND REINDEER</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>In few places are the dogs so numerous and
so noisy as at Forteau, and Sister Bailey’s
team held the primacy for speed and condition
and obedience to command—yet she
ruled them by moral suasion and not by kicks
and curses. That does not mean they were dog
angels. Every “husky” is in part a wolf,
and the gentlest and most amiable that fawns
upon you will in a twinkling go from the Dr.
Jekyll to the Mr. Hyde in his make-up when
the breaking-point is passed. The leaders of
the pack were two monsters named Scotty
and Carlo, and they were rivals to the end of
the tether. Carlo was a sentimentalist of a
hue between fawn and grey: his greatest
pleasaunce was to put his forepaws on your
shoulders and lick your nose ere you could
stave him off. Scotty’s nose—he was black
and white—was embossed with the marks of
many bitter duels. Probably the other dogs
could read those marks, as a Bret Harte cowboy
could read the notches on a gun, and he
won respect commensurate with the length and
breadth of the scratches. Scotty came with us
on the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span>, as his mistress was leaving
for a rest in England shortly. It was a job
to persuade him aboard the boat, but once
there he entered into a tacit agreement, as between
gentlemen, that he should have the after
deck while Fritz, our official dog, monopolized
the prow. Scotty had the better of the bargain,
for his bailiwick included the cook’s
galley. But Fritz could sleep on the floor of
my cabin, though whenever I looked for him
on the floor he was snugly ensconced in a forbidden
lower bunk, curled up like a jelly roll.
He learned to vacate without even a word
when I gazed at him reproachfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All Sister Bailey’s dogs, and a great many
more, converged upon the beach when Fritz
swam ashore and shook himself free from
such marine algae as he might have collected on
his course. We kept Fritz close at heel, but
there were constant alarums and incursions.
As we sauntered along the shore path by the
fish-flakes where the women were turning over
the fish under the threat of rain, Fritz was in
a measure taken into the loosely cohesive
<span class='it'>plunderbund</span> of Sister Bailey’s pack. They
seemed to be saying to him after their fashion:
“Oh, well, you are a foreigner from that ship
out yonder in the cove, to be sure, but here
we are passing one hostile tribe after another,
and we may need you any time to help us out
in a scrap, so you may as well travel along
with our bushy tails—though yours points
toward the ground, and you can’t be very much
of a dog, after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For dogs appeared in squads, platoons, companies,
battalions, even as iron-filings cluster
to a magnet. There was a most outrageous
and unholy pow-wow when we had gone about
five houses from the beach. All the dogs from
near and far piled into it like hornets from
a broken nest. There was no speech nor
language known to dogdom in which their
voices were not heard with howls and imprecations.
Alas! even the gentle Sister Bailey had
to abandon for the nonce her policy of moral
suasion and get in among her protégés with
thwackings of a bit of driftwood and a few
well-directed pushes (not to say kicks) of the
foot. Any moderate impact, when a scrap is
in full swing, rebounds from the tough integuments
like hailstones landing on a tin roof.
Even an every-day argument of these beasts
sounds like wholesale murder. It is a pathetic
fact that with all the affectionate responsiveness
of some of the animals to human notice
there always lurks a danger. If you are a
stranger, meeting a strange pack, it is well to
keep your eyes upon them, and if you have not
a stick in your hand, or a stone ready to throw,
it is wholesome to stoop groundward and pretend
you have a missile. Then, nine times
out of ten, they will scatter. So often one
would like to believe they are all dog, with
all of the dog’s graces and goodnesses—but
there reigns in the breast of each a vulpine
jealousy that easily and instantly mounts to
a blood-heat of maddened fury. Dogs of the
same litter will fight as furiously and savagely
as born enemies, though they may recognize
in the traces intuitively the leadership of their
mother at an age far beyond that at which
civilized puppies become as contemptuous of
their mother as she is of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unhappily, there are many cases on authentic
record when young children and old people,
unable to defend themselves, have been devoured
by dogs—not necessarily when the dogs
were starving. A grewsome climax was
reached when in the “flu” epidemic of
1918-19 on the Labrador the dogs fell on the
dead and the dying and the enfeebled survivors
could not stem the onslaught. No wonder,
then, that Dr. Grenfell, with all his manifest
affection for dogs that he has known, insists
that the importation of reindeer is the salvation
and the solution. Stubbornly the folk
of the northern tip of the peninsula and the
Labrador coast cling to the huskies that were
banished, in favour of cows, horses, pigs and
chickens, by their more sophisticated southern
neighbours. Uncle Philip Coates at Eddy’s
Cove is the only man on that shore, as far as
is known, who keeps pigs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A fisherman landing on an island off Cape
Charles, on the side away from his home,
found himself the object of the unwelcome attentions
of a pack of dogs who were acting on
the principle of the uncouth villager of the old
story who cried: “ ’Ere’s a stranger, Bill—let’s
’eave ’arf a brick at him.” He is sure they
would have pounced on him and polished off
his bones, had he not seen one dog he knew—the
leader. He called the dog’s name; the
wolfish creature halted instantly. When the
name was repeated, the dog slunk off, his
ragged retinue at his heels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is sad to think that the dogs that will perform
so nobly in the traces are such bad actors
when they have nothing to do but to pick a
quarrel in places where perhaps there is no
foliage but the proud curled plumage of their
tails. They are beside themselves with excitement
when after the summer siesta they are
harnessed to the komatik again. When the
driver smartly rubs his hands and cries, “See
the deer!”—or anything he pleases—it augments
the fever. In Labrador “ouk, ouk!”
turns the team to the right—perchance with
a disconcerting promptness—and “urrah,
urrah!” swerves it to the left. The corresponding
directions in Newfoundland are
“keep off!” and “hold in.” No reins are
used—some drivers use no whip. The books
of Dr. Grenfell abound in affectionate reference
to the better nature of these animals and
their extraordinary fidelity to duty. Like most
of the people of the land, they do not fear to
die. Their life is largely of neglect and pain:
they spend much of their time crawling under
the houses to get out of the way. Their
pleasure is the greater when they find a human
playmate ready to throw a stick into the water
for them. Grand swimmers are they, and they
will plunge into the coldest sea; and if they
are hungry they dive in for a small fish without
concern. It is hard to find a time when
they are not ready to set their fangs to food—“full-fed”
is an ideal condition to which most
of them seldom attain. A square meal of
whalemeat is their millennium. “I don’t see
what satisfaction they get out of it,” said
“Bill” Norwood—one of the volunteer
“wops” building the Battle Harbour reservoir.
“The meat in winter comes to them
in frozen hunks, and they slide it down at one
gulp, to melt in their stomach. That’s not
quite my idea of enjoying a meal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a yawl that the <span class='it'>Strathcona</span> dragged
astern three plaintive huskies, to be committed
to the pack at St. Anthony, hungrily sniffed
the meat-laden breeze that blew from our
deck. They were perturbed at finding themselves
going to sea. I may add that when they
got ashore the youngest of the three—a mere
baby—jumped on a rock and bit the nose of
the leader of the St. Anthony pack, Eric by
name, thereby winning respect for himself
and his two comrades among the aborigines
who might otherwise have fallen upon them
and rent them limb from limb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dogs at Battle Harbour live up to the
name of the settlement. Like all other
“huskies,” they are ready to fight on slight
provocation, and the night is made vocal with
their long-drawn ululations. Their appetite
is insatiable—they devour with enthusiasm
whatsoever things are thrown out at the
kitchen door—they even ate a towel that went
astray—and when nothing better offers they
will wade into the water in quest of caplin, or
cods’ heads. In their enthusiasm for food the
dogs will dig through boards to get at cattle
and pigs, and cows and chickens seldom live
where the dogs are numerous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The murderous proclivities of the dogs of
the Labrador furnished one of the chief reasons,
as has been said before, why the Doctor
went to such great pains and to such a relatively
large expense to import and domicile the reindeer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was wildly exciting work, I can tell you,
lassoing those reindeer and tying their legs in
that country over yonder,” he said, as the
<span class='it'>Strathcona</span> rounded the rugged bread-loaf
island of Cape Onion. He pointed to the settlement
of Island Bay behind it. “There we
were blown across the bay on the ice—dogs,
komatik and all—roaring with laughter at
our own predicament, helpless before the great
gale of wind.” Thus he recalls without bitterness
the costly undertaking whose fruition
has been—and still is—one of his dearest
dreams. Conveying the captured reindeer
across the Strait in a schooner to Canada with
almost nobody to help him was a Herculean
task. Some day the Legislature at St. John’s
may see fit to divert a little money to establishing
the docile and reliable reindeer in place
of treacherous and predatory dogs. It is a
greater loss to the island than to Grenfell that
the scheme must wait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a mob of dogs in every village, a mob
actuated most of the time by an insatiable
hunger driving it forth in quest of any sort
of food, it has been impossible in most places
to keep a cow or a goat, and hay is prohibitively
costly to import. Dr. Grenfell has described
with pathos how Labrador mothers, in
default even of canned milk for the baby, are
in the habit of chewing hard bread into a pulpy
mass to fill the infant’s mouth and thus produce
the illusion of nutriment until it is able
to masticate and assimilate “loaf” for itself.
In few countries is milk so scarce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reindeer might be the cow of the Labrador.
The reindeer is able to find a square
meal amid the moss and lichens, and it yields
milk so rich as to require dilution to bring
it down to the standard of cow’s milk, while
it is free from the peculiar flavour of the milk
of the goat. The Lapps make the milk into
a “cream cheese” which Dr. Grenfell has
tried out on his sledge journeys and heartily
endorses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nearly three hundred reindeer were obtained
by Dr. Grenfell in Lapland in 1907,
with three Lapland families to herd them and
teach herding. They were landed at Cremailliere,
(locally called “Camelias”), three miles
south of St. Anthony. At the end of four
years the herd numbered a thousand. In 1912,
twelve hundred and fifty at once were corraled.
Poaching and want of police protection
made it desirable to transfer the animals
across the Straits to Canada. Some of them,
by virtue of strenuous effort, were collected
in 1918 and transported to the St. Augustine
River district where now they flourish and increase
in number. Some day, it would seem
from the great success of the reindeer-herds
of Alaska—introduced by Dr. Sheldon Jackson
and fostered by the United States Government—these
fine animals will surely replace
the dogs on the Labrador, when local prejudice
against them has been overcome or has
evaporated. They are useful not merely for
the milk but for the meat and the skins, as
well as for transportation. They live at peace
instead of on the precarious verge of battle.
The “experiment” has not collapsed in dismal
failure. It is only in abeyance to the
ultimate assured success, and it is not too much
to predict that another generation or two will
see the reindeer numerous and useful throughout
the Labrador.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span><h1>XII<br/>A WIDE, WIDE “PARISH”</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>To take the measure of the man Dr.
Grenfell is and the work he does it is
necessary to know something of the
land and the waters round about, where he
puts his life in jeopardy year after year, day
unto day, to save the lives of others. There
is much more to “Dr. Grenfell’s parish” than
the “rock, fog and bog” of the old saying.
Such observations as are here assembled are
the raw material for the Doctor’s inimitable
tales of life on the Labrador.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great fact of life here is the sea, and
much of existence is in giving battle to it.
The little boys practice jumping across rain-barrels
and mud-puddles, because some day
they hope to get a “ticket” (a berth on a
sealer) and go to the ice, and when it is “a
good big copy from pan to pan”—that is to
say, a considerable distance from one floating
ice-cake to the next—their ability to jump like
their own island sheep may save their lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='sign'></a></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i156.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0012' style='width:70%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'>SIGNAL HILL, HARBOUR OF ST. JOHNS.</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The word “copy” comes from the childish
game of following the leader and doing as he
does. A little piece of ice is called a knob, and
a larger piece is a pan. A pan is the same
thing as a floe, but the latter expression is
not in common usage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every youth who aspires to qualify as a
skipper must go before an examining board of
old sea-wise and weather-wise pilots, and prove
himself letter-perfect in the text of that big
book, “The Newfoundland and Labrador
Pilot and Guide.” His examiners scorn the
knowledge of the book, very often, for they
have the facts at the fingers’ ends from long
and harsh experience of the treacherous
waters, with the criss-cross currents, the hidden
reefs, the sudden fogs, the contrary winds.
So they delight to make life miserable for the
young mariner by heckling him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The disasters that now and then overtake
the sealing-fleet are ever present in the minds
of those who do business in these waters.
They know what it means for a ship’s company
to be caught out on the ice in a snow-storm,
far from the vessel. In early March
the wooden ships race for the Straits of Belle
Isle, and three days later the faster iron ships
follow. When they get to where the seals are
sunning themselves around the blow-holes in
the ice, the crew go out with their gaffs
(staves) and kill the usually unresisting animals
by hitting them over the back of the head.
It sounds like simple and easy hunting, and
in good weather it is. But a long-continued
storm changes the complexion of the adventure
to that of the gravest peril.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One captain saved his men by making them
dance like mad the long night through, while
he crooned the music to them. At the end of
each five minutes he let them rest on their
piles of gaffs, and then they were made to
spring to their feet again and resume the frantic
gyrations that kept them from freezing to
death. In the same storm, the <span class='it'>Greenland</span> of
Harbour Grace lost 52 of her 100 men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They still talk of the fate of the <span class='it'>Queen</span> on
Gull Island off Cape St. John, though the
wreck took place nigh unto forty years ago.
There was no lighthouse then. The island lifts
its head hundreds of feet above the mean of
the tides, and only the long rank grass and
the buttercups live there in summer. But this
was in a December night, and the wind blew
a gale. There were six passengers—a woman
among them. When the passengers had
battled their way ashore through the leaping
surf, the crew went back on the doomed ship
to salvage some of the provisions. For they
knew that at this forsaken angle of the island
no help from any passing ship was likely till
the spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The passengers toiled to the top of the bleak
islet, lugging with them a fragment of a sail.
The crew, aboard the vessel, were carried by
the furious winds and waters out to the Old
Harry Shoals, where they lost their lives when
the sea beat the vessel to pieces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sequel is known by a little diary in
which a doctor—one of the hapless half-dozen—made
notes with his own blood till
his stiffening fingers refused to scrawl another
entry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seems from this pathetic note-book that
the six at the end of a few days, tortured with
thirst and starvation, drew lots to see who
should die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lot fell to the woman. Her brother
offered himself in her place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the entries in the book cease; and the
curtain that fell was not lifted till spring
brought a solitary hunter to the island. He
shot a duck from his boat, and it fell in the
breakers. Afterwards he said it was a phantom
fowl, sent from heaven to guide him. For
he did not see it again, though he landed and
searched the beach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he saw splinters flung high by the surf
that seemed to him a clear indication of a
wreck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He clambered to the top of the islet. There
he found, under the rotted sail, the six bodies,
and in the hand of one, was a piece of flesh
torn from one of the bodies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even when their lives are endangered the
fishermen preserve their keen mindfulness of
the religious proprieties. Caught on an ice-pan
together, Protestants and Catholics prayed,
their backs to one another, on opposite sides
of the pan—and the same thing has happened
in ships’ cabins. The sailors are not above a
round oath now and then, but there are many
God-fearing, prayerful men among them.
“These are my sailing orders, sir,” said an
old retired sea-dog to me as he patted the cheek
of his Bible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phrases of the sea enter into every phase of
daily human intercourse. “You should have
given yourself more room to veer and haul,”
said the same old sailor to me when I was in
a hurry. Fish when half-cured are said to be
“half-saved,” and a man who is “not all
there” is likely to be styled “half-saved.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down killik” is used impartially on arrival
at the fishing grounds or at home after a
voyage—the “killik” being a stone anchor for
small craft or for nets. (A “killy-claw” is
of wood with the stone in the middle.) You
may hear an old fisherman say of his retirement
from the long warfare with the sea for
a living: “My killiks are down; my boat is
moored.” One of them who was blind in his
left eye, said as he lay dying, referring to his
own soul: “She’s on her last tack, heading for
I don’t know where: the port light is out, and
the starboard is getting very dim.” A few
minutes later he passed away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ordinary talk is full of poetry. “If I
could only rig up a derrick, now, to hoist me
over the fore part of the winter,” an old salt
will say, “wi’ the help o’ God and a sou’westerly
wind and a few swyles I could last
till the spring.” By “swyles,” of course, he
means “seals.” A man’s a man when he has
killed his seal. Seal-meat is an anti-scorbutic,
and the sealers present the “paws,” or flippers,
as great delicacies to their friends. A “big
feed” is a “scoff.” Sealing brings men together
in conviviality and comaraderie, and it
is the great ambition of most of the youth of
Newfoundland to “go to the ice.” Many
are the stowaways aboard the sealing craft.
If a man goes “half his hand” it means he
gets half his catch for his labour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seal” is pronounced “swyle,” “syle,” or
“swoyle” and Swale Island also takes its
name from this most important mammal.
Seals wandering in search of their blow-holes
have been found as far as six or seven miles
inland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As might be expected, there survives in the
vernacular—especially of the older people—many
words and phrases that smack of their
English dialect origin, and words that were
the English undefiled of Chaucer’s or Shakespeare’s
day. Certain proper names represent
a curious conversion of a French name no
longer understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Dorsetshire dialect v is used for f, and
in Newfoundland one hears “fir” pronounced
“vir” or “var.” Firewood is “vir-wood.”
Women who are “vuzzing up their
vires” are fussing (making ready) their fires.
We have “it wouldn’t be vitty” in place of
“it wouldn’t be fitting.” A pig “veers”; it
does not farrow. The use of “thiccy” for
“this” is familiar to readers of “Lorna
Doone.” “The big spuds are not very jonnick
yet” means that the potatoes are not well
done. If something “hatches” in your
“glutch,” it catches in your throat. Blizzard
is a word not used, and a lass at school, confusing
it with gizzard, said it meant the insides
of a hen. The remains of birds or of animals
are the “rames.” “O yes you, I ’low” is
a common form of agreement. To be photographed
is to be “skitched off,” and of snapshots
it is sometimes said by an old fisherman
to a “kodak fiend”: “I heard ye firin’ of
’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cass ’n goo,” for “can’t you go” may be
heard at Notre Dame Bay, as well as “biss ’n
gwine” for “aren’t you going?” and “thees
cass’n do it” for “thee can’t do it.” The
berries called “harts” (whorts) are, I presume,
the “hurts” of Surrey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A vivid toast for a sealer going to the icefields
was “Bloody decks to ’im!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When bad weather is brewing, “We’re going
to have dirt” is a common expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A fisherman who had hooked a queer creature
that must have been first cousin to the
sea-serpent said, “It had a head like a hulf,
a neck like a harse; I cut the line and let it
go to hell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here is a puzzler: “Did ye come on skits
or on cart and dogs?” That means, “Did you
come on skates or on a dog-sledge?” Dog-cat
is a dog-sledge. Cat is short for catamaran,
which is not a sea-boat but a land-sledge,
so that when you hear it said: “He’s
taken his dog and his cat and gone to the
woods” you may know that it means “He’s
taken his dog and his sledge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just as we change the position of the <span class='it'>r</span> in
going from <span class='it'>three</span> to <span class='it'>third</span>, we find the letters
transposed in “aps” for aspen, “haps” for
hasp, “waps” for “wasp” and “wordle” for
world. Labrador is Larbador, and “down to
the Larbador” or “down on the Larbador”
are common expressions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instead of “the hatch” the telescoped form
“th’ ’atch” is used. We have “turr” for
“tern” and “loo” for “loon,” and “yammit”
(emmet) for “ant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tendency to combine syllables is illustrated
in the pronunciation of Twillingate as
Twulngate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A scaffolding for fish is known as a “flake.”
Here the split cod are outspread to dry and,
by the way, a decision of the Newfoundland
Supreme Court declares “cod” and “fish”
synonymous. The scaffolding is made of poles
called longers, and it is suggested that these
“longers” are the “longiores” which Caesar
used to build bridges, according to his Commentaries.
A silk hat is known as a beaver,
or behaviour, and so when you hear it said,
“I saw Tom Murphy; he must have been at
a funeral; he had his behaviour on,” it means
not that he was circumspect in his conduct,
but that he wore the formal headgear.
“Sammy must ’a’ been writin’ some poetry.
I saw him just now a-humourin’ of it with his
foot.” Cannot you see the bard beating out
the rhythm with his foot, as a musician sometimes
does when he is sure that he is in time
and the rest are mistaken?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“South’ard,” “north’ard,” “east’ard,”
“west’ard” are current maritime usage, and
the adjective “wester” is heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Legal Latin is drawn upon for “tal qual”—<span class='it'>talis
qualis</span>—applied in a bargain for fish “just
as they come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here is a quaint one. The end of a pile,
above the surface of a wharf, is a gump-head.
Gump and block are one and the same thing.
We of the United States use the word
“gump” or “chump” figuratively for a
“blockhead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The curse o’ Crummle on ye” is a rural
expression still heard, and refers to Cromwell’s
bloody descent on Ireland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I find my kinkhorn and I can’t glutch”
means “I have a pain in my throat and I can’t
swallow.” The kinkhorn is the Adam’s apple.
A man at Chimney Cove remarked: “I have
a pain in my kinkhorn and it has gone to my
wizen (chest).”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dog is often called a “crackie.” Caribou
is shortened to “boo.” A door that has stuck
is said to be “plimmed up.” A man who ate
hard bread and drank water said “It plimmed
up inside and nearly killed me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To say of a girl that she “blushed up like
a bluerag” refers to the custom of enclosing
a lump of blueing in a cloth when laundering
clothes. “The wind baffles round the house”
is a beautiful way of saying that it was blustering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bruise” is a very popular dish of hard
bread boiled with fish, and with “scrunchins”
(pork) fried and put over it. It is the equivalent
of Philadelphia’s famous “scrapple.” A
guide, admitting that bread and tea are the
staple articles of diet in many an outpost, said
reflectively: “Yes, that’s all those people live
on. Now there’s other things. There’s
beans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When a man says that his hands are “hard
afrore” (hard frozen) we remember Milton
in “Paradise Lost,” “the air burns frore.”
Frozen potatoes are “frosty tiddies.” Head
is often called “heed.” “Tigyer,” said by an
old man to a mischievous lad, means “Take
yerself off.” “Is en?” is a way of saying
“Is he?” An old man cut his finger and
said that he had a “risen” on it, which is
certainly more of a finality than a “rising.”
“I’m going chock to Gargamelle” means “I’m
going all the way to Gargamelle,” the latter
name from “garçon gamelle,” said to signify
“the boy who looks after the soup.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instead of “squashed,” “squatted” is a
common word, as in the expression “I
squatted my finger.” And there are many
other provincialisms not in the dictionaries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fathom is a land-measure of length, as
well as a sea-measure of depth. The leading
dog of a team is six or seven “fathoms”
ahead of the komatik.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Start calm” means perfectly calm, and
then they may say expressively “The wind’s
up and down the mast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Puddick” is a common name for the
stomach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take it abroad” is “take it apart”; “do
you relish enough,” is “have you eaten
plenty?” “Poor sign fish” means that fish
are scarce. Woods that are tall are said to be
“taunt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These few examples of distinctive phraseology
might be multiplied a thousand-fold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for the proper names, a fascinating field
of research lies before a patient investigator
who commands the leisure. Here are but a
few of countless examples that might be cited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>French names have been Anglicized in
strange ways. Isle aux Bois thus becomes Isle
of Boys—or, as pronounced on the south
coast, Oil of Boys or Oil o’ Boy. Baie de
Boules has lost the significance of boulders
that bestud its shores in the name Bay Bulls.
The famous and dreaded Cape Race, near the
spot where the beautiful <span class='it'>Forizel</span> was lost, gets
its name from the French “razé,” signifying
“sheer.” Reucontre is Round Counter; Cinq
Isles has become St. Keels, and Peignoir is altered
to Pinware or Pinyare. Grand Bruit
is Grand Brute; the rocky headland of Blomidon
that nobly commands the mouth of the
Humber is commonly called Blow-me-down;
Roche Blanche is Rose Blanche.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One would scarcely recognize Lance-au-Diable
in Nancy Jobble. Bay d’Espoir has
been turned into its exact antithesis, in the
shape of Bay Despair. L’Argent Bay is now
Bay Le John. Out of Point Enrage is evolved
Point Rosy, and St. Croix is modified to Sancroze
(Sankrose).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Children’s names are likely to be Biblical.
They are often called by the middle name as
well—William James, Henry George, Albert
Edward. Merchants’ ledgers must take account
of a vast number of nicknames that are
often slight variants on the same name—Yankee
Peter, Foxy Peter, Togo Ben, Sailor Ben,
Bucky Ben, Big Tom, Deaf Tom, Young Tom,
Big Jan, Little Jan, Susy’s Jan, Ripple Jan,
Happy Jack. Thomas Cluett comes to be
called Tommy Fiddler, whereupon all the children
become Fiddlers, and the wife is Mrs.
Fiddler. The family of Maynards is known
as the Miners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little boys have a mischievous way of
teasing one another as “bay noddies.” The
noddy is a stupid fish that is very good at
catching the smaller fry and then easily allows
itself to be robbed of its prey. The children
cry:</p>

<p class='pindent'>If a boy doesn’t go across the Straits before
he is sixteen, he must be “shaved by Neptune.”
It is almost a disgrace not to have
gone to the Labrador. Neptune is called
“Nipkin.” “Nipkin’ll be aboard to shave you
tonight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they are cleaning fish, the last man

<p class='pindent'>Some of the older residents are walking
epitomes of the island lore. They know a
great deal that never found lodgment in books.
Matty Mitchell, the 63-year old Micmac guide,
now a prospector for the Reid-Newfoundland
Company, was a fellow-passenger on the mail-boat.
He was full of tales of the days when
the wolf still roamed the island’s inner fastnesses.
I asked him when the last of which
he knew were at large. He said: “About
thirty years ago I saw three on Doctor’s Hill.
I have seen none since. There are still lots
of bears and many lynxes. Once I was attacked
by six wolves. I waited till the nearest
was close to me—then I shoved my muzzle-loader
into his mouth and shot him and the
other five fell away. Another time I was
attacked by three bears who drove me into
a lake where I had to stay till some men who
had been with me came to the rescue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My grandfather was with Peyton when
Mary March and another Indian woman were
captured at Indian Lake. Mary March died
at St. John’s, and was buried there; the other
one was brought back to the shore of the
lake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know what minerals you
are finding when you are prospecting?” I
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was three times in the Museum at St.
John’s,” he answered. “I see everything in
the place. That way I know everything that
I look at when I go to hunt for minerals and
metals. I hear a thing once—I got it. I see
a thing once—I got it. I never found gold—but
I got pearls from clams, weighing as much
as forty grains. I can’t stay in the house. I
must be out in the open. If I stay inside I
get sick. I take colds. I’ve been twice to the
Grand Falls in Labrador. At the upper falls
the river rises seven times so”—he arched
the back of his hand—“before the water goes
over. The biggest flies I ever saw are there.
They bite right through the clothes. You
close the tent—sew up the opening. You burn
up all the flies inside. Next morning there are
just as many.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another passenger was the Rev. Thomas
Greavett, Church of England “parson,” with
a parish 100 miles long on the West Coast
between Cow Head and Flower’s Cove. He
had to be medicine-man and lawyer too, and
in his black satchel he carried a stomach-pump,
a syringe, eight match-boxes of medicine and
Gibbon’s “Decline and Fall.” He told me
how he hated to use the mail-boat for his
parish visiting, for it generally meant sleepless
nights of pacing the deck or sitting in the
lifeboat in default of a berth. He carried a
petition, to go before the Legislature, reciting
the many reasons why the poor little boat on
which we were travelling is inadequate to the
heavy freight and passenger traffic in which she
is engaged. With accommodations for hardly
more than 50 passengers, she has carried 210,
235 and even 300, which meant acute discomfort
for everybody and the open deck, night
and day, for many passengers. What is
wanted is a big, heavy ice-breaker. The <span class='it'>Ethie</span>
never was meant by her Glasgow builders to
fight the Humboldt Glacier bit by bit as it
falls into the sea. In December she was
wrecked off Cow Head in a gale, fortunately
with no loss of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I don’t know of a harder-working lot than
the crew and captain of a boat that undertakes
to carry freight and passengers between
southern ports of Newfoundland and the
Labrador.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Take the experience of this vessel, the <span class='it'>Ethie</span>,
in the summer of 1919 as an example. Under
a thoroughly capable and chart-perfect skipper,
Captain English, she made several ineffectual
attempts to get to Battle Harbour
through the dense ice-jam before she finally
made that roadstead on June 24. When I
met her at Curling to go north, a week late,
at the end of August, she had just come out
of a viscous fog of four days’ duration in
the Strait of Belle Isle and in that fog she had
escaped by the closest of shaves a collision
with a berg that towered above her till the
top of it was lost in the fog. She carried so
many passengers, short-haul or long-distance,
that every seat in the dining saloon was filled
with weary folk at night and some paced the
decks or sat on the piles of lathes or the oil-barrels.
Lumber and barrels were stored
everywhere, the hold was crammed, and cattle
in the prow came and went mysteriously as
the vessel moved into one cove or bight or
tickle after another in the dead of the night
or the silver cool of the early morning. The
clatter of the steam-winch with the tune of
babies strange to the sea-trip, the slap and
scuffle of the waves on our sheet-iron sides
and the banging of the doors as the vessel
writhed in her discomfort made an orchestra
of many tongues and percussions. The boat
was so heavy with her cargo of machinery,
oil, lumber, flour ($24 a barrel at Battle Harbour),
cattle and human beings that the deck
outside my stateroom was hardly two feet
out of water. There were four of us in the
stateroom, but the population changed almost
hourly from port to port, so that I had barely
time to get acquainted with a fellow-passenger
ere I lost him to look after his lobster or fish,
or his missionary labours. One of the ship’s
company was going to teach school at Green
Island Cove at the northern tip of Newfoundland.
He told me he would get $275 for ten
months’ work and out of it would have to pay
board. Yet out of that salary he meant to
put by money to pay for part of a college
education at St. John’s. “How old are you?”
I asked. “Not yet eighteen, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is easy to see why Dr. Grenfell’s heart
and hand go out in a practical and helpful
sympathy to those whose battle with grim, unmitigated
natural forces and with harsh circumstance
is unending. The commonest question
asked of anyone who returns from a visit
to the Labrador is “Why do people live
there?” Despite the fog and the cold, the sea-perils
and the stark barrenness of the rocks,
the Labrador has an allurement all its own.
It has brought a sturdy explorer like William
B. Cabot of Boston (“Labrador” Cabot)
again and again to the rivers and inlets and the
central fastnesses, where he shares the life of
the Montagnais and the Nauscapee Indians;
and the same magic has endeared the Labrador
to those who year upon year continue the quest
of the cod and the seal and know no life other
than this. Whatever place a man calls his
home is likely to become unreasonably dear to
him, however bare and poor it looks to visitors;
and that is the way with the Labrador.
But he who cannot find by sea or land a wild
and terrible beauty in the waters and the luminous
skies and the long roll and lift of the
blue hills must be insensible to some of the
fairest vistas that earth has to show. Grenfell
and his colleagues do not concede that life on
the Labrador is dull or that the environment is
sterile and monotonous and cheerless. As one
of the brave Labrador missionaries, the
Rev. Henry Gordon, has written, “Not only
does Labrador rejoice in some of the finest
scenery in North America, but she also possesses
a people of an exceptionally fine type.”
Surely it is not right to think of such a
country as a land only of rocks, snows and
misery.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span><h1>XIII<br/>A FEW “PARISHIONERS”</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>A typical interior gladdened by the
Doctor’s presence is this on the
Southern Labrador. A drudge from
Nancy Jobble (Lance-au-Diable) is scrubbing
the floor, for the mother is too ill to look to
the ways of her household. The drudge instead
of singing is chewing on something that
may be tobacco, paper or gum, and as she
slings the brush about heartlessly she gives
furtive eyes and ears to the visitors. The
walls are bestuck with staled and yellowed
newspapers. There are no pictures or books.
There is a wooden bench before the linoleum-covered
table, on which are loaves of bread,
ill-baked. There is a stove, of the “Favourite”
brand with kettle and teapot simmering.
A tarnished alarm-clock from Ansonia,
a mirror, a wash-stand, shelves with
china, tin cans and shreds of bread, a baby’s
crib, a rocking-chair and two more benches
forlornly complete the inventory. There is
nothing green in sight from the besmirched
windows but grass and people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A telegraph operator was reading a volume
of the addresses of Russell Conwell when we
entered his not overtasked laboratory. The
book bore the title “How to Get Rich Honestly.”
“ ’Fraid I’ll never get any further than
reading about it!” exclaimed the man of the
keys and wires. Dr. Grenfell took the book
and presently became engrossed in the famous
address called “Acres of Diamonds.” It
seemed to him the sort of literature to fire
the ambition of his neighbours under the
Northern Lights, with its instances of those
who made their way defiant of the odds and
in spite of all opposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A very young minister at another Labrador
watering-place said to the Doctor: “You
needn’t leave any of your books here. I’m not
interested in libraries. I’m only interested in
the spiritual welfare of the people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A run of six miles by power-boat across
Lewis Inlet took us to Fox Harbour and the
house of Uncle George Holley. In recent
years the power-boat, even with gasoline at
the prevailing high prices, has become the
fisherman’s taxicab or tin Lizzie, and Oh! the
difference to him. He bobs and prances out
over the war-dance of the waves with his
barrels and boxes easily, where once it was a
mighty toiling with the sweeps to make his
way. The run across the inlet went swiftly
and surely past an iceberg white as an angel’s
wing though with the malign suggestion of the
devil behind it: and there were plenty of
chances to take photographs from every possible
angle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle George had on the stage a skinned
seal, some whalemeat, salted cod and a few
barrels of salmon. His wife showed us a
tiny garden with cabbages, lettuce, rhubarb,
radishes and “greens.” One year, she said,
she had a barrel of potatoes. Indoors she
managed to raise balsam, bachelor’s buttons
and nasturtiums. Nowhere in the world do
flowers mean more to those that plant them.
Constantly there comes to mind H. C. Brunner’s
poem about a geranium upon a window-sill:
for the flowers which it needs incessant
care to keep from the nipping frost come to
be regarded as not merely friends but members
of the family. Uncle George, a fine,
patriarchal type, told vividly how with a dog
whip nine fathoms long the expert hand could
cut off the neck of a glass bottle without upsetting
the bottle, and take the bowl from a
man’s pipe or the buttons off his coat. No
wonder the huskies slink under the houses
when they see a stranger coming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The winter of 1918-19 was especially terrible—or
“wonderful” as would be said here—because
of the visitation of the “flu.” Conditions
were bad enough in Newfoundland,
but in Labrador the “liveyers” (those who
remain the year round) fought their battles
in a hopeless isolation illumined by heroic
self-abnegation on the part of a tiny handful
of persons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When spring released the Labrador Coast
from the grip of the ice, and the tragic tale
of the winter was told, the Newfoundland
Government dispatched the <span class='it'>Terra Nova</span>
(Scott’s Antarctic vessel) to the aid of the
afflicted. Then news filtered out to the world
of plague conditions during that terrible winter
more dreadful than those which De Foe has
chronicled. While reading the gruesome details,
one is reminded of the long, lonely and
hopeless fight of the early Jamestown colony
against sickness and starvation. Throughout
the bitter months the Red Death stalked its
dread way up and down the Coast, with almost
no doctors, nurses or medicines to check the
disease. Whole families were stricken, the
living were too weak to bury the dead or even
to fight off the gaunt dogs that hovered hungrily
about the houses; and hamlets were wiped
out while neighbouring villages were unable
to send aid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few sentences from the diary of Henry
Gordon, the brave missionary at Cartwright,
on Sandwich Bay, will suffice to show what a
hideous winter his people passed through. Of
this man Dr. Grenfell said to me: “Instead
of a stick with a collar on it we have a man
with a soul in him.” He is always laughing—incurably
an optimist, and a great Boy Scout
leader. The following are condensed excerpts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wednesday, Oct. 30, 1918. Reached
Cartwright 8 a.m. Mail-boat had brought
‘the great Plague’ and nearly half the population
was down with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thursday, Oct. 31. Nearly everybody
down now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nov. 1. Whole households stretched inanimate
on floors, unable even to feed themselves
or keep fires going.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nov. 2. Feeling rotten. Head like a
bladderful of wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nov. 7. Busy all a.m. arranging graves
and coffins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nov. 8. Gale N. E. with snow-storms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nov. 17. Two of bodies too much
doubled up to put in coffin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nov. 21. Will Leaming in from Indian
Harbour with news that ten are dead at North
River still unburied and only three coffins.
The rest are too sick and dismayed to help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nov. 22. (At North River). Some had
lain in their beds three weeks and the stench
was appalling. Old Mrs. L. W., aged 71, only
survivor of five, lived alone for a fortnight
with four dead. No fire, no wood, only ice,
which she thawed under her arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nov. 26. Number burials now totals 26.
Population little over 100.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dec. 14. Find five little orphans living
alone in a deserted house in a deserted cove,
bread still frozen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dec. 19. 12 dead in North River out of
population of 21.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dec. 25. (Christmas Day). Service
10.30. Only six communicants, but considerable
‘Communion of saints.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jan. 1, 1919. (At Cape Porcupine, in
Herbert Emb’s one-room house). ‘A sort of
damp earthy smell met one on entering, but
thanks to frost, body was not so bad as expected.
More like mouldering clay than anything.
Right on his side was his little girl,
actually frozen on to him, so that bodies came
off the bunk in one piece.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jan. 3. Grave-blasting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jan. 8. Total deaths: Cartwright, 15;
Paradise, 20; Separation Point, 7; North
River, 13; Strandshore, 9; Grady, 1; Hare
Islands, 4; Sandhills, 4; Boulter’s Rock, 5;
North, 12.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These do not seem large figures, but in
settlements of half a dozen houses or less they
represent a very large proportion of the inhabitants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>News of the armistice with Germany did not
reach Mr. Gordon until January 9, which
shows how far from the world was this region
within a hundred miles of the summer hospital
at Battle Harbour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is to be noted that nearly all the children
who died perished of starvation, because their
elders could no longer feed them and the
“loaf” was too frozen to be eaten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Eskimo settlements suffered still more
grievously. The bodies were buried at sea.
Dogs were eating the bodies, and had to be
shot. Sometimes the survivors were too weak
to drive the dogs from the dead and the
dying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hebron was wiped out. At Okkak 200 died
of 267, and on August 15 there were four
widows and two little girls left, who were
waiting to be taken away. Nain was not so
hard hit, but it is said that forty perished out
of several hundred. Zoar and Ramah had
already passed out of existence before the
“flu” came. It is estimated that the resident
Eskimo population on the coast, numbering
600 to 700, was cut nearly in half.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The people seem to think that Dr. Grenfell
can accomplish miracles. One is reminded of
the words of the sister of Lazarus, “Lord,
if thou hadst been here, my brother had not
died.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Richard Dempster, our mail-carrier,” said
good Parson Richards, of Flower’s Cove,
“owes his life to the Doctor. Something had
infected his knee. The poison spread to his
hip. He wouldn’t have lived twelve hours if
the Doctor hadn’t made seven incisions in his
right leg with his pocket-knife to let out the
poisoned blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='happ'></a></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i187.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0013' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'>HAPPY DAYS AT THE ORPHANAGE, ST. ANTHONY.</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Once when I was travelling with him, at
Pine’s Cove we found a family had left because
the woman had seen a ghost. The Doctor
prayed with her, and offered to go and live in
the house himself to prove that she was the victim
of an illusion. At Eddy’s Cove there was
hard glitter ice which would have cut the dog’s
paws. We thought we couldn’t go on. While
we debated what to do there came a snowfall
that spread the ice with a glorious soft blanket,
ideal for travel. That’s just the way Providence
always seems to favour the Doctor when
he goes abroad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That man never came to the parsonage and
went without leaving me with the desire to do
better and be better. Every single time it
was the same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once we were on the go with the dogs and
the komatik four days from St. Anthony to
Cricket (Griguet). Much of the time the
Doctor had to run beside the komatik. He
struck out a new way, deep in snow. ‘Don’t
you ever get tired, Doctor?’ I asked. ‘I don’t
know that I ever was tired in my life,’ was his
answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A day or two after that dreadful experience
on the ice-pan which he described in
a book, he was at Cricket, and I went to see
him. He was still suffering from the effects
of the frost-bite. ‘Will you come to the mass
meeting of the churches tonight?’ I said. He
didn’t hesitate a moment. ‘Yes—send a dog-team
and I’ll come.’ He not merely came but
delivered an address of an hour’s duration,
and I never heard him speak with greater
fervour. He seemed spiritualized by the experience
through which he had so recently
passed.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span><h1>XIV<br/>NEEDS, BIG AND LITTLE</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It is high time to give Dr. Grenfell’s great
work the broad, sure underpinning of a
liberal endowment. It may be true that
“an institution is the lengthened shadow of
one man”; but the one-man power of Grenfell’s
personality is not immortal, and the work
is too important to be allowed to lapse or to
languish when he no longer directs, inspires
and energizes all. To endow the work now,
when many concerns of lesser moment are
claiming their millions of dollars and their
thousands of devotees is to relieve the Doctor
of the ordeal of stumping the United States,
Canada and the British Isles to keep his great
plant going. Despite the volunteer assistants,
despite the aid of good men and women banded
in associations or toiling in groups or as individuals
at points far from Battle Harbour
and St. Anthony, despite the economy practised
everywhere and always, there is ever a
need, a haunting need, of funds; and a few
insular politicians and traders may talk as
elaborately as they please about Grenfell as an
interloper, with a task that does not belong to
him, but as long as Newfoundland does not
provide a sufficient subsidy, most of the money
must come from somewhere off the island. I
have heard some “little-islanders” say that
Dr. Grenfell ought to get out, and that Newfoundland
should take over his whole business,
but as long as Newfoundland does not
move to that end, and there is a woeful want
of doctoring and nursing at any outport on
the map, somebody with the flaming zeal of
this crusader has a place. Grenfell is doing
the work not of one man but of a hundred.
Could his cured patients have their say, there
would be no doubt about that endowment. If
grateful words were dollars, Grenfell would
be a multi-millionaire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It should not be necessary to explain in circumstantial
detail the constant and pressing
need of funds to carry on an enterprise that
covers so large a territory and involves so
many and such various activities. A chain of
hospitals and dispensaries, manned in large
part by eager and devoted volunteers, an orphanage,
an industrial school, a fleet of
boats—including the schooner <span class='it'>George B.
Cluett</span>—a Seamen’s Institute, a number of
dwellings for the staff personnel, the supplies
of food and coal and surgical apparatus and
medical equipment—all these items impose a
burden on the overtaxed time and strength of
the Doctor so considerable that it is not even
humane or moral to expect him to speak two
or three times a day as he does when he ought
to be taking a well-earned vacation. Countless
thousands are eager to hear the man himself
describe his work, and there is usually a
throng whenever and wherever he appears,
but to let him wear himself out in appealing
for the means to carry on is a waste of the
enormous man-power of a great leader of the
age. He does not cavil or repine, but he ought
to be saved from his own willingness to
overdo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never put up a building without having
the funds in hand,” he declared. “But when
it comes to work—I believe in beginning first
and asking afterwards. The support will
somehow come, if there is faith, but faint-heartedness
means paralysis of effort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the most important producers and
consumers of all Dr. Grenfell’s institutions is
the King George V. Seamen’s Institute at St.
John’s. The cornerstone of the four-story
brick building was laid in 1911. Sir Ralph
Williams (the Governor), Bowring Brothers,
Job Brothers, Harvey and Company, MacPherson
Brothers and other loyal and forward-looking
citizens got behind the plan: and
when the stone was swung into place by wire
from Buckingham Palace as King George V.
pressed the button, the sum of $175,000 was in
hand. The site contributed by Bowring
Brothers was valued at $13,000.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The enumeration of beds occupied, meals
served, baths taken, games played, books
loaned, films shown and lectures heard does
not begin to tell the story. Fishermen and
sailormen ashore are traditionally forlorn.
Men from the outports who drift into St.
John’s are like country lads who come wide-eyed
to a great city. It is not morally so bad
for them as it was ere prohibition came and
clamped the lid upon the gin-mills. But still,
these are lonely men, friendless men, with
very little money: and the Institute has a
helping hand out for them, to befriend them
from the moment they set foot on shore.
Moreover, there is a dormitory given over to
the use of outport girls: since it is seen that
hard as things may be for Jack ashore they are
harder yet for sister Jill, who knows even less
of the great round world outside the bay and
needs even more protection than her brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Institute at last is able to show a small
balance on the right side of the ledger. Since
the first thought of those who ran it has been
service, they are satisfied to come out only a
little better than even. No charge of graft
or profiteering lies here: and those who are fed
and housed and warmed find it “a little bit
of heaven” to be made so comfortable at an
expense so small.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the start, less than a decade ago, there
were croakers who said there would be but a
slim and scattering patronage: but now nearly
all the beds are in use every night. In the
dread influenza year, 1918, the Institute was
invaluable as an Emergency Hospital, which
treated 267 patients. The city hospital at St.
John’s is small and always overcrowded. If
the Institute had not been available the results
of the epidemic would have been still more
terrible. When in February, 1918, the
<span class='it'>Florizel</span> was wrecked on the coast between St.
John’s and Cape Race the survivors were
brought here, and the Institute also prepared
the bodies of the dead for burial. And on
other occasions it has done good service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Demobilized men of the Army and Navy
coming into town from the outports use the
building as a clubhouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since the high cost of living has not spared
Newfoundland, the rate for the young women
who are permanent boarders has had to be
raised to $4.00 a week. In parts of Newfoundland
that is a good deal of money, but
it is not much compared with what these girls
would have to pay in the absence of the Institute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The successful operation of the Institute
is an outstanding object-lesson, and a source
of particular satisfaction to its founder and
chief promoter. It has triumphantly answered
and silenced the objections of those who at the
start declared that the only possible result
would be calamitous failure. It has survived
the shock of the discovery that some of its
earlier administrators were unworthy of their
charge; it has outlived the era of struggle and
set-back; it has so clearly proved its place and
its meaning in the community where it is established
that if it were destroyed the merchants
themselves would be prompt to undertake
its replacement. It is as impressive a
monument as any to the enduring worth of the
devoted labours of Wilfred Thomason Grenfell,
and as conspicuous a proof as could be
offered that his great work by land and sea
deserves an Endowment Fund.</p>

the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
